| AUBURN UNIVERSITY | NASA | UNDERSTANDING THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT AT EARTH IS CRITICAL DUE TO BOTH SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS AND PRACTICAL NEEDS. HOWEVER  THE ACCELERATION MECHANISM OF EARTH S ENERGETIC PARTICLES CONSISTING OF RADIATION BELTS IS NEITHER FULLY UNDERSTOOD NOR QUANTIFIED BECAUSE OF 1) SPARSE IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS BETWEEN THE ALTITUDE OF ~5.8 RE AND GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT (GEO) AND 2) DIFFICULTIES TO DISENTANGLE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT ACCELERATION MECHANISMS. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO DEVELOP A MINIATURIZED  HIGH-ENERGY-RESOLUTION RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON TELESCOPE (HERT) THAT CAN BE EASILY ACCOMMODATED INTO FUTURE CUBESAT/SMALLSAT MISSIONS TO UNDERSTAND AND QUANTIFY THE EFFECT OF ACCELERATION MECHANISM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE RADIATION BELTS TO GEO USING A NOVEL METHOD OF PROBING ELECTRON FLUX OSCILLATIONS. HERT IS A COMPACT (&LT;3U) TELESCOPE WITH THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE HIGH ENERGY RESOLUTION (DE/E&LT;10%) MEASUREMENTS OF 1   7 MEV ELECTRONS. WITH A COMPACT DESIGN AND MUCH HIGHER ENERGY RESOLUTION IN COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS TELESCOPE-TYPE INSTRUMENTS (E.G.

| WOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE | NASA | OBJECTIVES: THIS PROPOSAL WILL ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS UPON WHICH NASA FORMULATES AND IMPLEMENTS SEARCH-FOR-LIFE STRATEGIES ON OCEAN WORLDS. ANTICIPATING THAT THE DIVERSITY OF OCEAN WORLDS MAY VARY GREATLY IN THE ABUNDANCE AND PRODUCTIVITY OF LIFE THEY COULD SUPPORT (THEIR BIOLOGICAL POTENTIAL) AND THE NATURE AND ABUNDANCE OF EVIDENCE FOR LIFE THEY COULD MANIFEST (THEIR BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL)  WE ASK: ON WHICH OCEAN WORLDS  AND WITH WHAT MEASUREMENTS  WILL WE HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL TO SUCCESSFULLY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF LIFE? WE WILL INTEGRATE ASTROBIOLOGY  OCEAN SYSTEM  AND PLANETARY SCIENCES TO PURSUE THIS QUESTION  GUIDED BY TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES:(I) BOTH BIOLOGICAL POTENTIAL AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL ARE GOVERNED BY A NETWORK OF GEOPHYSICAL AND (BIO) GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES  NOT JUST STATIC CONDITIONS;(II) TO BE OF GREATEST UTILITY  EFFORTS TO QUANTIFY BIOLOGICAL POTENTIAL AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL MUST IDENTIFY WHICH OBSERVABLE FEATURES ARE MOST DIAGNOSTIC OF THAT NETWORK OF PROCESSES. WITH THIS BASIS  OUR PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) CONSTRUCT AND EMPLOY A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TO QUANTIFY THE DEPENDENCE OF BIOLOGICAL AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL ON GEOPHYSICAL AND (BIO)GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES; (2) CONDUCT AN EXTENSIVE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY WHICH OBSERVABLE FEATURES WOULD BE MOST POWERFULLY DIAGNOSTIC OF PROCESSES THAT DETERMINE BIOLOGICAL AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL. THE LATTER ANALYSIS WILL IDENTIFY HIGH PRIORITIES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON OCEAN WORLDS  PARTICULARLY SPACECRAFT MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES THAT CAN BEST RESOLVE BIOLOGICAL AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL  AND UNDERSTUDIED OCEAN SYSTEM PROCESSES AND SETTINGS  FOR WHICH EARTH ANALOGS SHOULD BE SOUGHT. IMPLEMENTATION: WE WILL ADDRESS THESE OBJECTIVES BY CONSTRUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  INFORMED AND GROUNDTRUTHED BY EXPERIMENTAL EFFORTS THAT CONNECTS THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT COULD GOVERN THE FLUXES OF MATERIAL AND ENERGY WITHIN AN OCEAN SYSTEM  AND THEREBY DETERMINE BIOLOGICAL AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL. THE PROCESSES ACTIVE WITHIN ANY OCEAN ARE INTEGRATED AT THE SYSTEM SCALE  RESPECTING NO DISCIPLINARY BOUNDARIES. CONSEQUENTLY  WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A TEAM WITH A DIVERSITY OF EXPERTISE IN ASTROBIOLOGY TOGETHER WITH LEADERS IN THE STUDY OF PROCESSES ACROSS THE VARIOUS INTERFACES OF THE EARTH-OCEAN-LIFE SYSTEM. OUR TEAM MEMBERS WILL WORK ACROSS A NETWORK OF SIX INTERCONNECTED INVESTIGATIONS. EACH INVESTIGATION IS INHERENTLY INTERDISCIPLINARY IN ITSELF BUT  AS IN EARTH S OCEANS  WE PREDICT THAT IT WILL BE AT THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT SETS OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT OUR MOST EXCITING AND ORIGINAL DISCOVERIES WILL BE MADE. OUR GOAL IS THUS TO MOVE BEYOND THE MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL EFFORTS PLANNED FOR EACH COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM  TO EXPLORE THE FEEDBACKS AND INTERCONNECTIONS AMONG THOSE COMPONENTS. WE WILL DO SO WITH DEDICATED SYNTHESIS ACTIVITIES THAT ENGAGE BOTH WITHIN AND BEYOND OUR TEAM  TO DEVELOP A FLEXIBLE INTERPRETIVE FRAMEWORK THAT INTEGRATES A DIVERSITY OF GEOPHYSICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL OBSERVATIONS TO QUANTIFY BIOLOGICAL AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL OF ANY OCEAN WORLD. SIGNIFICANCE: OUR PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A NEW CULTURE AT THE INTERSECTION OF ASTROBIOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY  WHERE BOTH DISCIPLINES CAN BUILD ON INSIGHTS AND METHODOLOGY GAINED FROM EACH OTHER. WE ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIVE TO MAJOR TOPIC 5 OF THE NASA ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGY 2015 IDENTIFYING  EXPLORING AND CHARACTERIZING ENVIRONMENTS FOR HABITABILITY AND BIOSIGNATURES AND OUR WORK WILL BOTH BROADEN AND DEEPEN COLLABORATION WITHIN THE NAI  PARTICULARLY THROUGH BRIDGING BETWEEN AND ADDING BROADER CONTEXT TO CAN 7 TEAMS: ROCK POWERED LIFE AND ICY WORLDS. OUR WORK WILL IMPROVE THE CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH WE CAN INTERPRET EXISTING AND PLANNED OBSERVATIONS (E.G.

| WOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE | NASA | FORESTS OF LARGE CANOPY FORMING KELPS  FOUND ON SHALLOW SUBTIDAL REEFS IN TEMPERATE WATERS AROUND THE WORLD  PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR SOME OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND VALUABLE COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. LARGE KELPS ARE ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS PROVIDING BOTH FOOD AND HABITAT TO A DIVERSE ARRAY OF BIOLOGICALLY AND COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES OF ALGAE  INVERTEBRATES  FISH  AND MARINE MAMMALS WHILE EXPORTING LARGE QUANTITIES OF ORGANIC MATTER TO ADJACENT LITTORAL AND CONTINENTAL SHELF ECOSYSTEMS. HOWEVER  KELP IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS  AND CLIMATE CHANGE HAS ALREADY IMPACTED THE GLOBAL ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF KELP FORESTS. CHARACTERIZING THESE CHANGES ON REGIONAL TO GLOBAL SCALES IS CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO ANTICIPATE THE IMPACTS OF FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ON THESE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEMS. CURRENTLY  HOWEVER  THERE IS A MARKED LACK OF DATA ON VARIABILITY AND TRENDS IN GLOBAL KELP ABUNDANCE. A RECENT METANALYSIS OF GLOBAL KELP TIME SERIES DATA HIGHLIGHTED POOR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DATA COVERAGE FOR MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. MUCH OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LONG-TERM TRENDS IN KELP ABUNDANCE COMES FROM A FEW WELL-STUDIED REGIONS  E.G. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL DATASET OF CHANGES IN KELP CANOPY ABUNDANCE FROM THE EARLY 1980S THROUGH THE PRESENT AND USE THIS DATA TO: CHARACTERIZE TRENDS IN KELP ABUNDANCE  IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS OF THOSE TRENDS  AND IDENTIFY THE REGION S MOST VULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE AN AUTOMATED ALGORITHM FOR IDENTIFYING KELP CANOPY FROM LANDSAT TM/ETM+/OLI. WE WILL VALIDATE THIS ALGORITHM WITH AN EXTENSIVE TRAINING DATA SET OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CITIZEN SCIENCE CLASSIFICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD  THUS MINIMIZING REGIONAL BIAS OF PAST EFFORTS. WE WILL THEN APPLY THIS ALGORITHM TO THE GLOBAL LANDSAT ARCHIVE. WE WILL EXPLORE TWO DIFFERENT AUTOMATED IMAGE ANALYSIS APPROACHES TO CREATE THIS GLOBAL DATASET. THE FIRST BUILDS ON OUR PREVIOUS METHODS COMBINING RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIERS AND MULTIPLE ENDMEMBER SPECTRAL UNMIXING ANALYSIS. THE SECOND APPROACH WILL DEVELOP NEW DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS USING A SUBSET OF OUR CITIZEN SCIENCE KELP VALIDATION DATA. WE WILL DOCUMENT TRENDS IN KELP ABUNDANCE AROUND THE WORLD AND EXAMINE THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS WATER TEMPERATURE (USING SATELLITE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE DATA)  NUTRIENT LEVELS (DERIVED FROM SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE-NITRATE RELATIONSHIPS IN CERTAIN REGIONS)  PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY AVAILABLE RADIATION (USING SATELLITE OCEAN COLOR DATA)  AND WAVE DISTURBANCE (USING REGIONAL AND GLOBAL WAVE MODELS). WE WILL MODEL THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF KELP AND IDENTIFY REGIONS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO FUTURE CHANGE. THE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KELP PRESENCE AND ABUNDANCE AND VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE VARIABLES. WE WILL USE CLIMATE MODELS TO PROJECT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE WILL IMPACT THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF KELP ON REGIONAL TO GLOBAL SCALES. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NEW METHODS TO MONITOR CHANGE IN TEMPERATE REEF ECOSYSTEMS ON GLOBAL SCALES  WHICH WILL IN TURN HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DRIVERS OF THESE CHANGES.

| WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY | NASA | ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOL LIGHT ABSORPTION IN THE SOLAR SPECTRAL REGION IS DOMINATED BY BLACK CARBON (BC) AND BROWN CARBON (BRC) AEROSOL EMITTED PRIMARILY FROM NATURAL COMBUSTION PROCESSES  SUCH AS WILDFIRES. BRC IS A CLASS OF LIGHT-ABSORBING ORGANIC AEROSOL (OA) WITH A BROWNISH OR YELLOWISH VISUAL APPEARANCE THAT STRONGLY ABSORBS SOLAR RADIATION IN THE BLUE AND NEAR ULTRAVIOLET (UV) WAVELENGTHS. THERE IS GROWING OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE OF THESE AEROSOLS BEING EMITTED IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS (UP TO 80% BY NUMBER AND MASS) FROM BIOMASS BURNING WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TOP-OF-ATMOSPHERE DIRECT RADIATIVE FORCING  ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE. ADDITIONALLY  THESE AEROSOLS EXHIBIT LIGHT ABSORPTION SPECTRA SIMILAR TO COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (CDOM)  WHICH CAUSES VARIATIONS IN OCEAN COLOR. THUS  THE STRONG NEAR-UV LIGHT ABSORPTION BY BRC AEROSOL POSES A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR UV-A RADIANCE INVERSION ALGORITHMS WHEN INVERTING SCENES  ESPECIALLY OVER OCEAN SURFACE  TO CONSTRAIN AEROSOL SINGLE SCATTERING ALBEDO (SSA)  AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH (AOD)  AND ITS VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION FOR ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION. OUR RECENT FINDINGS CONDUCTED AS PART OF A 2015 NASA ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION: LABORATORY RESEARCH STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THE COMPLEX REFRACTIVE INDICES OF BRC AEROSOL IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND DYNAMICALLY CHANGES AS A FUNCTION OF ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSING  THEREBY ADDING FURTHER COMPLEXITIES TO SATELLITE RETRIEVALS AND RADIATIVE FORCING CALCULATIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH (I) PREVAILING AMBIGUITY WHEN IT COMES TO MODELING THE SPECTRAL OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF BRC AEROSOL AS A FUNCTION OF DIEL CYCLE  AND (II) POORLY PARAMETERIZED NEAR-UV AEROSOL MODELS IN AEROSOL RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS  E.G. OZONE MONITORING INSTRUMENT S (OMI) OMAERUV. FIRST  WE WILL PERFORM CLOSURE ANALYSIS OF AEROSOL REFRACTIVE INDICES  OPTICAL AND PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES FROM MEASUREMENTS MADE BY THE PI S GROUP AS PART OF THE FIRE INFLUENCE ON REGIONAL AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTS EXPERIMENT (FIREX-AQ) FIELD CAMPAIGN DURING 2019. NEXT  THE OBSERVATIONALLY-CONSTRAINED  MULTI-SPACE PARAMETERS SPECTRAL OPTICAL PROPERTIES AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF BRC AEROSOL AS FUNCTION OF ALTITUDE AND ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSING WILL BE CONSOLIDATED INTO AN OPTIMIZED DATABASE FOR USE IN REMOTE-SENSING ALGORITHMS AND MODELS. THIS DATABASE WILL BE UTILIZED TO PERFORM FORWARD RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING FOR SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESSING HOW CHANGES IN AEROSOL ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING AS A FUNCTION OF ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSING AND AEROSOL LAYER HEIGHT (ALH) COULD INFLUENCE THE UVAI  WHICH IS THE METHOD USED FOR DETECTING AEROSOL ABSORPTION BY OMI FROM MEASURED RADIANCES. FINALLY  THE DATABASE WILL BE UTILIZED FOR OMAERUV RETRIEVAL OF AOD AND SSA FOR SELECT WILDFIRE EVENTS INTERSECTED BY OMI DURING FIREX-AQ AND COMPARED FOR IMPROVEMENTS OVER PAST PREDICTIONS AND WITH AERONET DATASET. THE DATABASE  WHICH WILL INCLUDE NEW KNOWLEDGE OF AEROSOL COMPLEX REFRACTIVE INDICES AND SSA AS FUNCTION OF WAVELENGTH  AND OTHER PARAMETERS INCLUDING ALH  ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSING  FIRE COMBUSTION CONDITIONS  FUEL AND FUEL MOISTURE CONTENT  COMPOSITION IS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT THE ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY IMPROVING THE REPRESENTATION OF BRC AEROSOL IN CHEMICAL TRANSPORT AND CLIMATE MODELS TOWARD ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR IMPACT ON RADIATIVE FORCING AND AIR QUALITY. | 3/6/2025 |  | $7,941.99 |

| UNIV OF WASHINGTON | NASA | TO ENABLE AND ADVANCE NASA S SEARCH FOR LIFE BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM  THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY TEAM WILL FOCUS ON A COMPELLING SCIENTIFIC QUESTION:  HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE WHETHER AN EXOPLANET CAN OR DOES SUPPORT LIFE?  IN ADVANCE OF CHALLENGING OBSERVATIONS  THE VPL WILL COMBINE SCIENTIFIC MODELS  OBSERVATIONS  AND FIELD AND LABORATORY DATA FROM MANY DISCIPLINES TO EXPLORE HOW A PLANET BECOMES AND REMAINS HABITABLE  AND IDENTIFY NEW BIOSIGNATURES IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTS. THIS RESEARCH WILL INFORM TARGET SELECTION FOR JWST FROM K2  TESS  AND GROUND-BASED EXOPLANET DISCOVERIES; HELP OBSERVERS RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY AND LIFE; AND INFORM UPCOMING NASA MISSIONS THAT WILL OBSERVE TERRESTRIAL EXOPLANETS SUCH AS JWST  AND THE HABEX  OST AND LUVOIR MISSION CONCEPTS. FIVE RESEARCH TASKS WILL ADDRESS OUR SCIENTIFIC QUESTION. TASKS A-D PROVIDE A SUITE OF SELF-CONSISTENT PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS BASED ON DATA AND MODELS THAT ARE VALIDATED AGAINST SOLAR SYSTEM PLANETS. THESE PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS ARE THEN INPUT TO TASK E  TO SIMULATE PLANETARY OBSERVATIONS AND DETERMINE THE DETECTABILITY OF SIGNS OF HABITABILITY AND LIFE. TASK A: SOLAR SYSTEM ANALOGS FOR EXOPLANETS. WE WILL USE OBSERVATIONS AND ATMOSPHERIC MODELS OF EARTH AND VENUS  AS WELL AS REALISTIC SIMULATIONS OF THE DISTANT SOLAR SYSTEM AND OTHER PLANETARY SYSTEMS  TO EXPLORE PROCESSES AND REMOTE-SENSING DISCRIMINANTS RELEVANT TO HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS  BIOSIGNATURES  AND FALSE POSITIVES. TASK B: THE EARTH THROUGH TIME. WE WILL UNDERTAKE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SYNTHESIS OF FIELD  LABORATORY AND MODELING EFFORTS TO CONSTRAIN ENVIRONMENTAL  ECOLOGICAL  AND REMOTELY OBSERVABLE PARAMETERS OF EARLY EARTH AND SIMILAR EXOPLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS  AS A FUNCTION OF DOMINANT METABOLISM. TASK C: THE HABITABLE PLANET. WE WILL DEVELOP AND USE COUPLED STELLAR  ORBITAL  INTERIOR AND 1-D TO 3-D ATMOSPHERIC MODELS TO EXPLORE TERRESTRIAL EXOPLANET FORMATION  DYNAMICS  COMPOSITION  ATMOSPHERIC EVOLUTION AND HABITABILITY. THESE ANALYSES WILL INFORM HABITABILITY ASSESSMENTS TO PRIORITIZE PROMISING EXOPLANETS FOR BIOSIGNATURE SEARCHES. TASK D: THE LIVING PLANET. WE WILL INTEGRATE FIELD AND LABORATORY RESEARCH WITH COUPLED CHEMICAL  CLIMATE AND ECOSYSTEM MODELS TO EXPLORE THE NATURE AND DETECTABILITY OF BIOSIGNATURES FOR DIFFERENT GEOCHEMICAL AND STELLAR ENVIRONMENTS. WE WILL IDENTIFY NEW REMOTESENSING ATMOSPHERIC  SURFACE AND TEMPORAL BIOSIGNATURES AND THEIR FALSE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES  AND QUANTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS TO PHOTOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTIVITY. TASK E: THE OBSERVER. WE WILL COMBINE OBSERVATIONS  ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES AND SIMULATIONS TO IMPROVE THE DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POTENTIALLY HABITABLE EXOPLANETS. WE WILL IMPROVE RETRIEVAL OF PLANETARY PROPERTIES FROM EXOPLANET MAPPING AND FROM DIRECT IMAGING  TRANSIT TRANSMISSION  AND HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY. OUR ANALYSES WILL DETERMINE OPTIMAL MEASUREMENTS AND OBSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR TERRESTRIAL EXOPLANET CHARACTERIZATION. THE PROPOSED EFFORT BENEFITS ASTROBIOLOGY AND THE NAI WITH A PROVEN  PRODUCTIVE  INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE TEAM WHOSE RESEARCH ADDRESSES KEY ASTROBIOLOGY PROGRAM GOALS  INCLUDING  CONSTRUCTING HABITABLE WORLDS    IDENTIFYING  EXPLORING AND CHARACTERIZING ENVIRONMENTS FOR HABITABILITY AND BIOSIGNATURES  AND  THE COEVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT.  THE UW S ASTROBIOLOGY DUAL-TITLE PHD PROGRAM AND OUR ASTROBIOLOGY RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINORITY UNDERGRADUATES STRONGLY SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF ASTROBIOLOGISTS. OUR TEAM MEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE KEY SCIENTIFIC LEADERSHIP FOR RELEVANT NASA MISSIONS. THE VPL WILL LEVERAGE THE MASSIVELY INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION ENABLED BY THE NAI TO PROVIDE A UNIQUE SYNTHESIS OF NASA PLANETARY AND EARTH SCIENCE MISSION DATA  MODELING AND RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES THAT INFORM AND SUPPORT NASA ASTROBIOLOGY AND ASTROPHYSICS MISSION OBJECTIVES. | 3/6/2025 |  | $17,223.95 |
| UNIV OF WASHINGTON | NASA | NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE REVEALED RAPID CHANGES IN ICE DISCHARGE FROM GREENLAND  WITH MANY OF THE ICE SHEET S OUTLET GLACIERS HAVING ACCELERATED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT IN THAT THEY SHOW GREENLAND S MASS BALANCE CAN FLUCTUATE RAPIDLY AND UNPREDICTABLY. DESPITE THE LARGE MAGNITUDES OF THESE CHANGES  WE DO NOT YET UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES CONTROLLING FAST FLOW WELL ENOUGH TO DETERMINE THEIR LONG-TERM IMPACT ON SEA LEVEL. OBSERVATIONS MADE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS  INCLUDING THOSE FROM OUR PRIOR PROJECTS  INDICATE LESS POTENTIAL FOR RUN-AWAY ICE LOSS THAN WAS INITIALLY FEARED WHEN THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS OF RAPID CHANGE WERE MADE. NONETHELESS  OUTLET GLACIER DYNAMICS REMAIN A  WILD CARD  IN THE SEA-LEVEL PROJECTIONS AS NOTED IN THE LAST TWO INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) ASSESSMENTS. IMPROVING SUCH PREDICTIONS AND GAINING A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS THAT DRIVE MASS BALANCE REQUIRES ANNUAL TO SUB-ANNUAL OBSERVATIONS OF OUTLET GLACIER VARIABILITY (VELOCITY  ELEVATION  AND ICE FRONT POSITION) TO AVOID ALIASING OF THE RAPIDLY VARYING SIGNALS. FURTHERMORE  ALTHOUGH GLACIERS CAN CHANGE FAR MORE RAPIDLY (SUB-ANNUAL SCALES) THAN EXPECTED  DECADAL-SCALE OBSERVATIONS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED FOR CENTURY-SCALE PROJECTION. THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MEASURING VELOCITY IN GREENLAND IS MATURE AS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH OUR ONGOING AND PAST GREENLAND ICE MAPPING PROJECTS (GIMP-1&2). THROUGH THESE PROJECTS  WE HAVE REPEATEDLY MEASURED ICE VELOCITY IN GREENLAND  ESTABLISHING A RECORD FROM 2000 TO PRESENT. THROUGH GIMP-3 WE WILL CONTINUE THIS EFFORT TO EXTEND THE RECORD OF ICE FLOW VELOCITY THROUGH 2022  A PERIOD WHEN GREENLAND LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE RAPIDLY WITH THE CURRENT WARMING. THE GIMP-3 PRODUCTS WILL BE ENTIRELY COMPATIBLE WITH PRIOR PRODUCTS  BUT WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW SENSORS THAT HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED IN THE LAST 5 YEARS (LANDSAT 8  SENTINEL 1A/B AND SENTINEL 2A/B) TO GREATLY IMPROVE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SAMPLING. IN ADDITION  WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF LANDSAT TM DATA TO EXTEND THE RECORD BACK IN TIME TO 1984. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RESULTS FROM OUR EARLIER PROJECTS  GIMP-3 WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT NEARLY FOUR-DECADE-LONG PRECURSOR DATA SET FOR THE NISAR L-BAND SAR MISSION SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH NEAR THE END OF THE DECADE AS A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN NASA AND THE INDIAN SPACE AGENCY. IN ADDITION  GIMP-3 VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS WILL PROVIDE A STRONG COMPLEMENT TO THE THINNING MEASUREMENTS MADE BY NASA S ICESAT-2 AND ICEBRIDGE MISSIONS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $10,692.02 |

| UNIV OF WASHINGTON | NASA | ENERGY AND HEAT FLUX AT THE OCEAN SURFACE ARE VITAL TO MANY PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY PROCESSES AND MORE ACCURATE FLUX OBSERVATIONS ARE NEEDED FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS OF COUPLED EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS. HIGH QUALITY SATELLITE MEASUREMENT OF THESE FLUXES AT GLOBAL SCALE HAS LONG BEEN A CENTRAL GOAL OF NASA S EARTH SCIENCE PROGRAM. THE OCEAN REMOTE SENSING COMMUNITY RECOGNIZES THAT PRESENT-DAY MICROWAVE SENSORS LACK THE PRECISION TO MEASURE NEAR-SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY  OFTEN DUE TO UNRESOLVED VARIABILITY IN THEIR VERTICAL GRADIENTS WITHIN THE MARINE PLANETARY BOUNDARY LAYER. THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE NEEDED TO INFER THE THERMAL STABILITY NEAR THE AIR-SEA INTERFACE  AND THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN THIS STABILITY HAVE FIRST-ORDER IMPACTS ON BOTH THE SENSIBLE AND LATENT HEAT FLUX. WHAT IS NEEDED TO IMPROVE NASA S CAPABILITIES IN OCEAN FLUX MEASUREMENT FROM SPACE ARE NOVEL REMOTE SENSING APPROACHES THAT COMPLEMENT PRESENT AND FUTURE RADIOMETER DATA AND PROVIDE INDEPENDENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE AIR-SEA INTERFACE THERMAL STABILITY. | 3/6/2025 |  | $49.43 |

| UNIV OF WASHINGTON | NASA | TRANSITING PLANETS FROM THE KEPLER  K2  AND TESS MISSIONS PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEASURE THE RADII OF VERY SMALL PLANETS  APPROACHING THE SIZE OF THE EARTH (AND EVEN SMALLER). HOWEVER  FOR THE MAJORITY OF THESE SYSTEMS WE CANNOT MEASURE THE MASSES OF THESE PLANETS FROM RADIAL VELOCITY: EITHER THE STARS ARE TOO FAINT AND/OR THE RADIAL VELOCITY AMPLITUDES TOO SMALL. SO  THE QUESTION REMAINS: WHAT ARE SMALL PLANETS MADE OF? MOSTLY ROCK AND IRON? IF SO  HOW MUCH OF EACH? OR A GASEOUS ENVELOPE AS WELL? HERE WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE THE CONSTRAINTS UPON THE COMPOSITIONS OF TRANSITING EXOPLANETS WITH PHOTODYNAMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF MULTI-PLANET SYSTEMS. WE WILL TAKE A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM: A). BETTER CHARACTERIZING PLANET RADII IN MULTI-PLANET SYSTEMS TO REFINE THE RADIUS VALLEY MEASUREMENTS B). MEASURING PLANET MASSES FROM TRANSIT-TIMING IN A SUBSET OF THESE SYSTEMS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANET SIZES AT SHORT ORBITAL PERIODS HAS A MINIMUM NEAR ~1.8 TIMES THE RADIUS OF EARTH  REFERRED TO AS THE "RADIUS VALLEY" OR "FULTON GAP." THIS GAP HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO MULTIPLE POSSIBLE ORIGINS  WHILE EACH OF THESE MODELS MAKES PREDICTIONS FOR THE DEPENDENCE OF THE GAP ON THE PLANET  ORBITAL  AND STELLAR PROPERTIES. HOWEVER  DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THESE MODELS IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY I). THE PRECISION OF THE MEASUREMENTS OF PLANETARY RADII  AND II). THE SMALL SIZE OF THE SAMPLE OF PLANETS WITH HIGH-PRECISION MEASUREMENTS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A PATH TOWARDS REFINING PLANETARY RADIUS MEASUREMENTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TRANSITING MULTI-PLANET SYSTEMS IN THE KEPLER  K2 AND TESS DATASETS. THERE ARE TWO BARRIERS TO MEASURING PLANETARY RADII WITH HIGH PRECISION FROM TRANSITING PLANET DATA: UNCERTAINTIES ON THE PLANET-STAR RADIUS-RATIOS  THANKS TO DEGENERACY WITH IMPACT PARAMETER AND LIMB-DARKENING  AND UNCERTAINTIES ON THE STELLAR RADIUS MEASUREMENTS. MULTI-PLANET SYSTEMS OFFER THE PROSPECTS FOR ADDRESSING THESE LIMITATIONS WITH BETTER CHARACTERIZATION OF BOTH THE PLANETS AND THE STAR. OUR TOOL WILL BE A PHOTODYNAMICAL MODEL  WHICH COMBINE PHOTOMETRY AND DYNAMICS TO MODEL THE ENTIRE TRANSIT LIGHT CURVE SIMULTANEOUSLY. A JOINT ANALYSIS OF THE PLANETS WILL SOLVE BOTH PROBLEMS: IT WILL BREAK THE DEGENERACY BETWEEN PLANET RADIUS AND IMPACT PARAMETER  AND IT WILL PROVIDE A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATE OF THE STELLAR DENSITY. TOGETHER WITH LUMINOSITY/TEMPERATURE ESTIMATES FROM GAIA  THIS WILL PROVIDE PRECISE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PLANETARY RADII. WE WILL LEVERAGE TOOLS WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO CREATE A FULLY DIFFERENTIABLE PHOTODYNAMIC MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR CORRELATED NOISE. WE WILL THEN USE A HAMILTONIAN MONTE CARLO APPROACH TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF SAMPLING THESE HIGH DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THIS CAPABILITY WITH THE TRAPPIST-1 SYSTEM  IN WHICH CASE THE STELLAR DENSITY IS DETERMINED WITH A PRECISION OF ~2%  WHILE THE PLANETARY RADII ARE DETERMINED WITH A PRECISION OF 1-2%. WE PLAN TO APPLY A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY TO THE KEPLER  K2 AND TESS MULTI-PLANET SYSTEMS FOR WHICH THERE ARE 10^3 PLANETS WITH PERIODS &LT; 100 DAYS WHICH STRADDLE THE RADIUS VALLEY. IN A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WE CAN MEASURE MASSES OF THE TRANSITING EXOPLANETS FROM PHOTODYNAMICS BASED UPON TRANSIT-TIMING VARIATIONS (TTVS). WE WILL HELP TO REFINE THE MASS-RADIUS RELATION OF SMALL EXOPLANETS WITH OUR ANALYSIS  CONSTRAINING THEIR BULK DENSITIES  WHICH PROVIDES CONSTRAINTS ON THE COMPOSITIONS WHICH COMPLEMENT TO THE RADIUS VALLEY MEASUREMENTS. IN SUM  WE WILL DEVELOP A SAMPLE OF ORDER 10^3 PLANETS WITH PRECISELY MEASURED RADII TO CONSTRAIN THE RADIUS VALLEY TO HIGHER PRECISION THAN IS CURRENTLY POSSIBLE. FOR A SUB-SAMPLE  OF ORDER 10^2 PLANETS  WE WILL MEASURE MASSES WITH TTVS  YIELDING CONSTRAINTS ON THE PLANETS' DENSITIES AND COMPOSITIONS. TOGETHER THESE RESULTS WILL BE THE ABILITY TO BETTER TEST MODELS FOR THE ORIGIN OF THE VALLEY  AND THE COMPOSITIONS OF SMALL EXOPLANETS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $3,508.85 |

| WV UNIV RESEARCH CORPORATION | NASA | VENUS AND MARS ARE UNMAGNETIZED PLANETS  MEANING THAT THEY DO NOT POSSESS INTRINSIC DIPOLE MAGNETIC FIELDS. SUBSEQUENTLY  THE SUPERSONIC SOLAR WIND FLOW INTERACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE ATMOSPHERES AND IONOSPHERES OF BOTH BODIES  FORMING INDUCED MAGNETOSPHERES THAT ACT TO DEFLECT THE SOLAR WIND FLOW AROUND THE PLANETARY OBSTACLES. THE LACK OF STRONG DIPOLE MAGNETIC FIELDS LEADS TO HIGHLY DYNAMIC AND VARIABLE PLASMA ENVIRONMENTS AT BOTH BOW SHOCKS. CONSEQUENTLY  A WHOLE HOST OF LOW FREQUENCY (F ~&LT; 0.5 HZ) ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES ARE GENERATED THAT CAN PROPAGATE THROUGH THE SHOCKS INTO THE UPPER IONOSPHERES BENEATH AND INTERACT WITH PLANETARY IONS. OUR PROPOSED STUDY WILL COMBINE DATA ANALYSIS OF FOUR SPACECRAFT DATASETS  WITH GLOBAL HYBRID SIMULATIONS  TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS THAT THESE LOW FREQUENCY WAVES HAVE ON THE UPPER IONOSPHERES OF MARS AND VENUS. SPECIFICALLY  WE WILL EXAMINE THE STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OBSERVED LOW FREQUENCY WAVES QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF ION HEATING DRIVEN BY WAVE-PARTICLE INTERACTIONS AND DETERMINE HOW THIS HEATING INFLUENCES GLOBAL ESCAPE RATES OF PLANETARY IONS.

IN RESPONSE TO ELEVATED CO2 AND THE RESULTING WARMING  TERRESTRIAL WATER AND ECOSYSTEMS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES  E.G.  GLOBALLY SHRINKING SNOWPACK  GREENING PLANTS  EARLIER BLOOMING AND LEAFING OUT  AND DEPLETING GROUNDWATER. THE "MEMORY" OF CLIMATE CHANGE RETAINED IN THE SLOWLY VARYING STATES OF SNOW  SOIL WATER  AND GROUNDWATER CAN PERSIST VARIABLY FROM SEASONS TO YEARS  FEEDING BACK TO CLIMATE VARIABILITY WITH VARYING ENERGY AND WATER FLUXES MAINLY VIA PLANT ROOTS AND STOMATA. BASED ON THE WIDELY USED NOAH LAND SURFACE MODEL (LSM)  NOAH-MP SYSTEMATICALLY IMPROVES THE REALISM OF SNOW  SOIL WATER  GROUNDWATER  AND VEGETATION SCHEMES AND ENHANCES THE TERRESTRIAL WATER AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS. HOWEVER  WHETHER THE ENHANCED DYNAMICS AND IMPROVED REALISM OF TERRESTRIAL WATER AND ECOSYSTEMS HELP IMPROVE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. LIKE MANY OTHER LSMS  NOAH-MP USES STATIC  SHALLOW REPRESENTATIONS OF ROOTS AND NEGLECTS ROOT DYNAMICS  RESULTING IN LOW ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE TO DROUGHT AND A SHORTER CLIMATE "MEMORY." WE PROPOSE TO 1) ANALYZE SEASONAL AND INTER-ANNUAL VARIABILITY AND LONG-TERM TREND OF THE TERRESTRIAL WATER  ECOSYSTEM  AND CLIMATE DYNAMICS USING THE GROUND-BASED AND SATELLITE DATA OF TEMPERATURE  PRECIPITATION  SNOW  TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE (TWS) ANOMALIES  STREAMFLOW  AND LEAF AREA INDEX  ETC.; 2) ANALYZE THE COUPLING DYNAMICS OF SNOW  SUBSURFACE WATER  VEGETATION AND CLIMATE USING A NEW "COUPLING STRENGTH" BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF STREAMFLOW AND TWS CHANGE OVER RIVER BASINS IN THE CONTIGUOUS US (CONUS); 3) DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN OPTIMALITY BASED DYNAMIC ROOT MODEL INTO NOAH-MP  WHICH DESCRIBES OPTIMAL ADAPTATION OF THE ROOT PROFILE TO THE SOIL MOISTURE PROFILE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT WATER IN PLANT TISSUES TO MEET TRANSPIRATION DEMAND; 4) COUPLE NOAH-MP WITH THE NASA LAND INFORMATION SYSTEM (LIS) AND CONDUCT OFFLINE EXPERIMENTS DRIVEN BY THE NORTH AMERICAN LAND DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM (NLDAS) AND THE MODERN-ERA RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS FOR RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS (MERRA)-LAND ATMOSPHERIC FORCINGS; 5) COUPLE NOAH-MP WITH THE NASA-UNIFIED WEATHER RESEARCH AND FORECASTING MODEL (NU-WRF) AND CONDUCT COUPLED MODEL EXPERIMENTS IN THE CONUS USING NU-WRF/NOAH AND NU-WRF/NOAH-MP DRIVEN BY MERRA 2 REANALYSIS DATA. WE WILL TEST THREE MAJOR HYPOTHESES: H1: WITH MORE REALISTIC SCHEMES OF SNOW  GROUNDWATER  AND LEAF AND ROOT DYNAMICS  NOAH-MP/NU-WRF WILL PRODUCE MORE REALISTIC TERRESTRIAL WATER AND ECOSYSTEM STATES AS WELL AS MORE REALISTIC CLIMATOLOGY AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY THAN NOAH/NU-WRF. H2: INCLUDING LEAF AND ROOT DYNAMICS THAT CAN ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE WILL ENHANCE TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE AND TRANSPIRATION AND PRODUCE MORE REALISTIC CLIMATE VARIABILITY. H3: SHRINKING SNOW COVER HAS ACCELERATED WARMING OVER THE CONUS SINCE THE 1980S THROUGH POSITIVE SNOW-ALBEDO FEEDBACK; LESS (MORE) SNOW ACCUMULATION IN WINTER MAY RESULT IN LESS (MORE) SNOWMELT WATER INFILTRATING THE SOIL IN SPRING AND HENCE LESS (MORE) VIGOROUS VEGETATION AND A CONSEQUENT EFFECT ON SUMMER TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. THIS PROPOSAL IS A DIRECT REPLY TO THE MAP THEME OF "COUPLING IN THE EARTH SYSTEM" FOR "DEVELOPING AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE EARTH AS A COMPLETE  DYNAMIC SYSTEM." THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL HELP "LEAD TO AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING AND REPRESENTATION OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT EARTH SYSTEM COMPONENTS - SUCH AS LAND-ATMOSPHERE  .   OR THE INTERACTION OF THE CRYOSPHERE WITH OTHER COMPONENTS." | 3/6/2025 |  | $791.73 |
| UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA | NASA | SEISMIC STUDIES PROVIDE DEFINITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF INTERNAL PLANETARY STRUCTURE. REEXAMINATION OF SEISMIC DATA FROM THE MOON HAS PROVIDED AN IMPORTANT GLIMPSE OF ITS MANTLE AND CORE STRUCTURE  WHICH HAS BEARING ON ITS THERMAL  PETROLOGICAL  AND ROTATIONAL HISTORY. DATA SUGGEST THE PRESENCE OF A FLUID-LIKE TRANSITION LAYER BETWEEN THE LUNAR CORE AND MANTLE. THE MOON MAY THEREFORE STILL BE UNDERGOING CHEMICAL SEGREGATION AND THERMAL LAYERING. THE SEISMOLOGIST S CHALLENGE IS SUBSTANTIATING THIS VIEW. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF INTERNAL STRUCTURE HINGES ON INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF A LUNAR GEOPHYSICAL NETWORK (LGN) THAT INCLUDES ADVANCED SEISMIC SENSORS AND DEPLOYMENT METHODS. THIS NETWORK WILL NEED TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF AN INITIALLY SPARSE GRID AND IMPROVE UPON THE QUALITY OF APOLLO-ERA SEISMOGRAMS. THE BEST DESIGN FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS  CONSIDERING THEY WILL LIKELY BE DELIVERED BY A NEW CLASS OF SMALL COMMERCIAL LANDERS  IS CURRENTLY UNDERDEVELOPED. WE PROPOSE TO RAISE THE TRL OF A SILICON AUDIO COMMERCIAL-OFF-THE-SHELF GEOPHONE FROM 4 TO 6. THIS INSTRUMENT IS A NOVEL COMBINATION OF A CLASSIC SEISMIC GEOPHONE AND A LASER INTERFEROMETER. MICRON-SCALE MOVEMENTS OF AN INTERNAL MASS ARE RECORDED AS INDUCED CURRENT  WHILE SUBMICRON-SCALE MOTIONS ARE RECORDED BY THE LASER SYSTEM. THIS ALLOWS FOR A SMALL (<300GM)  SENSITIVE (1X10-8 M/S2/HZ1/2) BROADBAND (0.01-100HZ) SEISMIC INSTRUMENT THAT IS COMPETITIVE WITH STATE OF THE ART PLANETARY SEISMOMETERS. THE 3-AXIS INSTRUMENT IS INSENSITIVE TO TILT OVER 180. HERE WE PURSUE A REDESIGN OF THIS SYSTEM TO PARTITION THE ELECTRONICS  REPLACE COMMERCIAL PARTS WITH FLIGHTWORTHY PARTS AND PERFORM ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS TO DEMONSTRATE A SENSOR SUITABLE FOR DEPLOYMENT ON THE MOON. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HONEYBEE ROBOTICS  WE WILL ALSO PURSUE SUBSURFACE DEPLOYMENT USING A PNEUMATIC DRILLING TECHNIQUE  WHICH IS ENABLED BY THE SMALL SIZE OF THE SILICON AUDIO DEVICE. DRILLING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY COMPRESSED GAS JETTING THROUGH A CYLINDRICAL  3-AXIS  SEISMIC PROBE  STIRRING UP THE SOIL UNDERNEATH AND LOFTING THE REGOLITH OUT OF THE HOLE. BURIAL WILL ENABLE LOWER MASS AND POWER BY AUTOMATICALLY CREATING AN ISOTHERMAL ENVIRONMENT  WILL IMPROVE SEISMIC COUPLING  AND REDUCE NOISE FROM THE LANDER. THIS APPROACH WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED IN A PREVIOUS SBIR PROJECT IN A VACUUM CHAMBER WITH COMPACTED (1.9 G/CC) LUNAR SOIL SIMULANT. IN THE PROPOSED EFFORT  THE DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM WILL DEMONSTRATE SEISMIC SENSOR IMPLANTATION TO 50 CM DEPTH IN COMPACTED LUNAR SOIL SIMULANT UNDER VACUUM  ADVANCED FROM ITS CURRENT TRL 4 TO TRL 5. GOALS: 1) RAISE THE TRL OF A REDESIGNED SILICON AUDIO OPTICAL THREE-AXIS SEISMOMETER FROM 4 TO 6. 2) DEMONSTRATE BURIAL WITH THE HONEYBEE SYSTEM RAISING THE TRL FROM 4 TO 5. METHODOLOGY. 1) REDESIGN THE EXISTING SEISMIC INSTRUMENT BY PARTITIONING ELECTRONICS FROM THE SENSOR-HEAD. REPLACE THE LASER AND PHOTODIODE WITH PARTS SUITABLE FOR DEPLOYMENT ON THE MOON. REDESIGN THE REMAINING ELECTRONICS TO BE HOUSED IN A SUPPORT ELECTRONICS BOX. TEST THE SENSOR PROTOTYPE IN A RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT. 2) DEMONSTRATE BURIAL OF THE SEISMIC SENSOR WITH THE GAS JET SYSTEM IN A SIMULATED LUNAR REGOLITH  IN VACUUM. RELEVANCE: THE OBJECTIVES OF THE DALI PROGRAM ARE TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE INSTRUMENT MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES FOR LUNAR SCIENCE MISSIONS.  LGN IS IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY NEW FRONTIERS MISSION IN THE PLANETARY DECADAL SURVEY. DEMONSTRATION OF THE COMBINED SENSOR AND DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM WILL POSITION US FOR RAPID RESPONSE TO UPCOMING COMMERCIAL LAUNCH AND LANDING OPPORTUNITIES  EXPECTED AS EARLY AS 2019. AN EARLY LANDED COMMERCIAL PAYLOAD COULD TEST THREE DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS: BURIED IN THE REGOLITH  SITTING ON THE SURFACE  AND INTEGRATED INTO THE BODY OF THE LANDER. COMPARING THE QUALITY OF DATA FROM EACH SCENARIO WILL ALLOW US TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF SCIENCE THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED  WHICH IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO FUTURE LGN-LEVEL INSTRUMENTATION. | 3/6/2025 |  | $11,828.64 |
| UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA | NASA | THE RELEASE OF SAMPLE 71036 PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY VOLATILES IN A BASALT THAT HAS BEEN FROZEN AND SPECIALLY PRESERVED SINCE ITS RETURN  AND TO COMPARE THOSE RESULTS WITH BASALTS OF SIMILAR BULK CHEMISTRIES (71055  71035 &71037) THAT HAVE BEEN STORED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. THIS EXCEPTIONAL SUITE OF BASALTS ALSO OFFERS A CHANCE TO UNRAVEL THE HISTORY OF VOLATILE LOSS ON THE MOON  FROM THE ONSET OF MINERAL CRYSTALLIZATION THROUGH VESICLE FORMATION  SAMPLING  AND SUBSEQUENT CURATION. THIS IS A PROPOSAL REQUESTING THREE YEARS OF FUNDING TO CARRY OUT A DETAILED STUDY OF THE MAJOR  MINOR  AND VOLATILE ELEMENT CHEMISTRY (INCLUDING H ISOTOPES) OF HBEARING MINERALS AND MELT INCLUSIONS IN FOUR APOLLO 17 BASALTS  TO DOCUMENT THE OCCURRENCE AND MINERALOGY OF VUGS AND VESICLES  AND TO DETERMINE THE U-PB AGES OF THE BASALTS. THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THIS CONSORTIA STUDY ARE TO: 1) COMPARE  FOR THE FIRST TIME  THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF AND ABUNDANCE OF WATER IN H-BEARING MINERALS AND MELT INCLUSIONS OF LUNAR BASALTS CURATED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND A LUNAR BASALT THAT HAS BEEN FROZEN FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS. THIS WILL ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS (IF ANY) OF CURATION PREPARATION AND STORAGE METHODS ON THE EXCHANGE OF WATER BETWEEN SAMPLES AND THE TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERE; 2) COMPARE THE VOLATILE INVENTORIES (INCLUDING H ISOTOPES AND H  CL  AND S ABUNDANCES) OF LUNAR MINERALS AND GLASSES FROM SAMPLES PREPARED USING DIFFERENT SAMPLE PREPARATION TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT THAT SAMPLE PREPARATION HAS ON OUR ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE LUNAR VS TERRESTRIAL VOLATILE SIGNATURES; 3) DETERMINE THE ABUNDANCE  FORM  CHEMISTRY  AND MINERALOGY OF VUGS AND VESICLES  WHICH TOGETHER WITH H ABUNDANCE AND H ISOTOPE DATA (FROM GOALS 1+2) WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE CRITICALLY THE DEGASSING HISTORY OF LUNAR BASALTS AT THE APOLLO 17 SITE; AND 4) DEFINE THE ERUPTION AGE OF EACH OF THE FOUR BASALTS TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE FROM THE SAME LAVA FLOW. AGE CONSTRAINTS WILL THEN ALLOW US TO PLACE OUR VOLATILE DATA INTO THE WIDER CONTEXT OF THE MAGMATIC SUITE. GOALS 1 AND 2 REQUIRE SAMPLES THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN INDIUM METAL  ALONG WITH EXISTING AND NEW EPOXY MOUNTED THIN SECTIONS. THOSE GOALS WILL INVOLVE CHEMICAL AND TEXTURAL ANALYSES OF PHASES BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND ELECTRON PROBE MICRO-ANALYZER  AS WELL AS CHEMICAL (H ABUNDANCE) AND H ISOTOPES OF SUITABLE PHASES (APATITE  OLIVINE  PYROXENE  MELT INCLUSIONS) BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS AND NANOSIMS). GOAL 3 WILL INVOLVE X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY OF THE AMBIENT ROCK CHIPS TO DOCUMENT VESICLE DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS. GOAL 3 WILL ALSO UTILIZE FOCUSED ION BEAM TO MILL SECTIONS FROM VESICLES/VUGS FOR TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF CRYSTALS AND VAPOR DEPOSITS TO MAKE TEXTURAL  CHEMICAL  AND MINERALOGIC OBSERVATIONS. GOAL 4 CONSISTS OF U-PB DATING OF ZR-BEARING MINERALS AND PHOSPHATES IN EXISTING THIN SECTIONS AND A NEW THIN SECTION OF 71036 BY SIMS. RELEVANCE TO NASA AND APOLLO NEXT GENERATION SAMPLE ANALYSIS. WE WILL EXAMINE THE VOLATILE RECORD OF A COLD-CURATED APOLLO 17 BASALT  AS WELL AS THREE OTHER BASALTS COLLECTED DURING THE SAME MISSION THAT WERE CURATED CONVENTIONALLY. THE USE OF FROZEN SAMPLE 71036 IS CRITICAL TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY AND WILL PERMIT QUANTIFICATION OF THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT CURATION METHODS AND SAMPLE PREPARATION TECHNIQUES ON THE INDIGENOUS H BUDGET OF THE SAMPLES  AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM TO SOLVE IN PREPARATION FOR FUTURE LUNAR MISSIONS ANTICIPATED IN THE 2020S AND BEYOND. OUR DIVERSE CONSORTIA APPROACH IS REQUIRED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE INDIGENOUS VOLATILE HISTORY OF THIS SUITE OF BASALTS AND WILL MAXIMIZE THE SCIENCE DERIVED FROM SAMPLES RETURNED BY THE APOLLO MISSION ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AGO. | 3/6/2025 |  | $228.99 |

| UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA | NASA | THE HELIOSPHERE IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM IN WHICH THE TRANSPORT OF MASS  MOMENTUM  AND ENERGY FROM LARGE TO SMALL SCALES AND THE EVENTUAL DISSIPATION OF ENERGY AS PLASMA HEAT SHAPES THE GLOBAL EVOLUTION. AS MODELING THE PHYSICAL PROCESS INVOLVED AT ALL SCALES IS NOT YET TRACTABLE  WE STUDY IN THIS PROJECT THE MECHANISMS THAT ACT TO TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AND CHARGED PARTICLES USING A COMBINATION OF THEORETICAL MODELING AND IN SITU SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED WHICH MAY MEDIATE THIS ENERGY TRANSFER  BUT THERE IS NO CLEAR SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS AS TO WHICH OF THESE MECHANISMS OPERATE IN THE SOLAR WIND. EACH MECHANISM PREFERENTIALLY TRANSFERS ENERGY TO OR FROM PARTICLES WITH UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC VELOCITIES  AND MAY DOMINATE THE ENERGIZATION UNDER DIFFERENT SOLAR WIND AND PLASMA CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO OBSERVATIONALLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THESE PROPOSED MECHANISMS  WE WILL SEARCH FOR DISTINCT VELOCITY-SPACE SIGNATURES IN PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS AND ASSOCIATED ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS. THE NATURE OF THESE SIGNATURES WILL BE MOTIVATED BY ANALYTIC MODELS AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS  WHICH COMBINED WITH SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO ASSOCIATE PARTICULAR PLASMA AND SOLAR WIND PARAMETER REGIMES WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF PARTICULAR ENERGIZATION MECHANISMS. ..THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR TASKS: .1) IDENTIFY INSTANCES OF PARTICULAR ENERGIZATION MECHANISMS OPERATING IN THE SOLAR WIND FROM IN SITU OBSERVATIONS USING CORRELATIONS BETWEEN VELOCITY-SPACE PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS. .2) CHARACTERIZE THE PLASMA AND SOLAR WIND PARAMETERS FOR WHICH DIFFERENT ENERGIZATION MECHANISMS DOMINATE. .3) APPLY AN ALTERNATIVE STABILITY DETERMINATION METHOD TO SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS TO ASCERTAIN HOW UNSTABLE THE SOLAR WIND IS WHEN CONSIDERING MULTIPLE SOURCES OF FREE ENERGY. .4) IMPROVE EXISTING PARAMETERIZED MODELS FOR SOLAR WIND STABILITY USING THE ALTERNATIVE STABILITY DETERMINATION METHOD. ..CHARACTERIZING WHICH MECHANISMS ACT UNDER WHAT SOLAR WIND AND/OR PLASMA CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HELIOSPHERE  AND ENABLE GLOBAL MODELS OF THIS SYSTEM TO INCORPORATE MORE PHYSICALLY MOTIVATED SMALL SCALE PHYSICS. . | 3/6/2025 |  | $7,410.75 |
| UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA | NASA | THE SUITE OF CURRENT GLOBAL PRECIPITATION CLIMATOLOGY PROJECT (GPCP) PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS BASED ON GLOBAL OBSERVATIONAL DATA HAS BECOME A SCIENCE COMMUNITY STANDARD  HAVING BEEN USED IN OVER 3500 JOURNAL ARTICLES. THE CURRENT MONTHLY (1979-PRESENT) AND DAILY (1996-PRESENT) PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY RESEARCH GROUPS OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. THE GPCP IS THE PRECIPITATION COMPONENT OF AN INTERNATIONALLY COORDINATED SET OF (MAINLY) SATELLITE-BASED GLOBAL PRODUCTS DEALING WITH THE EARTH S WATER AND ENERGY CYCLES  UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE GEWEX OF THE WCRP. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE STRENGTHS OFFERED BY RECENT SPACE-BORNE SENSORS AND RETRIEVAL METHODS TO GENERATE THE NEXT GENERATION GPCP MERGED PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS IN HIGH LATITUDES (GPCP V3.HL) POLEWARD OF 40O LATITUDE AND INTEGRATE IT TO THE LATEST GPCP PRODUCT. REVISING GPCP DATA PRODUCTS OVER SUCH CLIMATE-SENSITIVE AND HYDROLOGICALLY IMPORTANT REGIONS HAS REMAINED A MAJOR GAP BECAUSE IN HIGH LATITUDES (1) GPCP UNCERTAINTIES ARE THE HIGHEST (ADLER ET AL.  2012) AND (2) GPCP HAS NOT GONE THROUGH ANY MAJOR UPDATE OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL IMPROVE GPCP IN HIGH LATITUDES BASED ON THE EMERGENCE OF ADVANCED NASA SENSORS  IMPROVED RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES  INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS ON PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT IN HIGH LATITUDES  AND ADVANCES IN NUMERICAL MODELING. WE WILL IDENTIFY  QUANTIFY  DIAGNOSE  AND REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE GPCP DATA PRODUCTS IN HIGH LATITUDES AND GENERATE AN IMPROVED LONG-TERM GPCP DATA RECORD CALIBRATED TO THE RECENT OBSERVATIONS FROM NASA S MISSIONS AND IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL GROUPS. CONNECTING THESE NEW  SHORT-TERM MEASUREMENTS TO THE LONG-TERM GPCP ANALYSIS WILL AMPLIFY THE IMPACT OF NASA S NEW MISSIONS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL USE VARIOUS EMERGING CAPABILITIES TO REVISE THE GPCP DATA PRODUCTS IN HIGH LATITUDES. THESE INCLUDE  BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: (1) RAINFALL AND SNOWFALL DATA FROM NASA CLOUDSAT MISSION (2006-PRESENT)  (2) SNOW ACCUMULATIONS THROUGH MASS BALANCE ANALYSES BASED ON NASA GRACE MISSION (2003-PRESENT)  (3) ADVANCES IN HIGH LATITUDE PRECIPITATION ESTIMATION DRIVEN BY THE NASA GPM MISSION  (4) RECENT INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS THAT ENHANCED SNOWFALL OBSERVATIONS AND BIAS CORRECTION FOR GAUGES  (5) RECENT OCEANIC SHIPBOARD PRECIPITATION OBSERVATIONS (OCEANRAIN) RECORD FOR SURFACE VALIDATION  AND (6) NEW GENERATION OF REANALYSIS (E.G.  NASA MERRA2) AND HIGH RESOLUTION REGIONAL MODELS (I.E.  ROCMO2). THE PROPOSED WORK WILL INVOLVE A MAJOR SHIFT TO NEW DATA STREAMS  MODERN LEVEL 2 ALGORITHMS  ADVANCED MERGER TECHNIQUES  AND FINER TIME AND SPACE RESOLUTIONS. WE WILL COMPLEMENT THE LATEST VERSION OF GPCP (V3)  CURRENTLY BEING FINALIZED (UNDER PREVIOUS MEASURES  PI: HUFFMAN)  THAT FOCUSES ON IMPROVEMENT OF GPCP OVER LOW AND MIDDLE LATITUDES USING TRMM AND GPM DATA. WE WILL ALSO BUILD ON THE METHODS DEVELOPED UNDER OTHER MEASURES EFFORTS (E.G.  PI: ADLER)  PROVIDING ERROR ESTIMATES FOR PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS AT MONTHLY TO DAILY TIME SCALES  SO THAT THE REVISED GPCP PRODUCTS WILL HAVE BIAS AND RANDOM ERROR ESTIMATES WITH UNPRECEDENTED ACCURACY. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL PRODUCE IMPROVED MONTHLY GPCP IN HIGH LATITUDES USING RECENT DATA SETS AND USE THE NEW CALIBRATIONS TO UPDATE THE ENTIRE GPCP RECORD (1979-PRESENT) AT 0.5 O X0.5O SPATIAL RESOLUTION  CONSISTENT WITH GPCP V3. ACCORDINGLY  DAILY PRODUCTS WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH UPDATED LEVEL 2 PRODUCTS AND WILL BE ADJUSTED TO MONTHLY PRODUCTS USING THE STANDARD GPCP PROCEDURES. THEREFORE  THE PROPOSED WORK WILL COMPLEMENT PREVIOUS MEASURES INVESTMENT  SO THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF GPCP WILL INCLUDE UPDATES ACROSS THE ENTIRE GLOBE. AS WELL  WE WILL WORK TO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL COMBINED OBSERVATION-MODEL ANALYSIS. THE PROPOSAL TEAM INCLUDES KEY GPCP DEVELOPERS. THIS ENSURES THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY WILL BE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED TO THE FINAL PRODUCT FOLLOWING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LONG-TERM CDR. | 3/6/2025 |  | $8,937.12 |

| UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA | NASA | SCIENCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: THE NORTH POLAR BASAL UNIT (BU) IS A SEDIMENTARY DEPOSIT OF WATER ICE AND LITHIC FINES BURIED WITHIN THE PLANUM BOREUM OF MARS. ITS LARGE VOLUME AND VOLATILE CONTENT MAKE IT ONE OF THE LARGEST WATER ICE RESERVOIRS ON THE PLANET  LIKELY THE THIRD LARGEST AFTER THE TWO POLAR LAYERED DEPOSITS. IT LIES STRATIGRAPHICALLY BETWEEN ANCIENT (~3.45 GA) AND VERY YOUNG (&LT;4 MA) UNITS  AND THUS PROVIDES THE POTENTIAL FOR A UNIQUE RECORD OF POLAR GEOLOGIC PROCESSES AND CLIMATE EVENTS SPANNING LARGE PORTIONS OF THE LATE HESPERIAN AND AMAZONIAN PERIODS. HOWEVER  SEVERAL KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED REGARDING THE STRATIGRAPHIC ARCHITECTURE  COMPOSITION  AND THE NATURE AND TIMING OF EVENTS THAT ARE RECORDED IN THE STRATA OF THE BU. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO RECONSTRUCT THE EVOLUTION OF THE BU THROUGH THE LATE HESPERIAN AND AMAZONIAN PERIODS. THE BU CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO SUBUNITS  RUP.S AND CAVI  BASED ON THEIR STRATIGRAPHY AND AGE. WE WILL REVEAL THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION  STRATIGRAPHY  AND COMPOSITION OF THESE UNITS  AND DETERMINE THE TIMING OF MAJOR ACCUMULATION AND EROSIONAL EVENTS THAT SHAPED THEM. WE DELINEATE THREE SETS OF SCIENCE QUESTIONS THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS SEVERAL NASA RESEARCH PRIORITIES DELINEATED IN MEPAG SCIENCE GOALS II-B1  III-A1-3 (AS SOLICITED IN ROSES C.9-4 3.2): (A) WHAT ARE THE EXTENT AND INTERNAL STRATIGRAPHIC STRUCTURES OF THE RUP.S AND CAVI UNITS? (B) WHAT IS THE RUP.S UNIT COMPOSED OF? IS THERE ANY SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN COMPOSITION? (C) WHAT WAS THE ACCUMULATION AND EROSION HISTORY OF THE BU? METHODOLOGY: OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH WORK WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A RICH AND DIVERSE SET OF MARS MISSION DATA  INCLUDING SUBSURFACE RADAR SOUNDING AT MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES FROM TWO DISTINCT RADAR SOUNDERS  HIGH-RESOLUTION VISIBLE IMAGERY  THERMAL IMAGERY  AND TOPOGRAPHY WHICH WILL BE ANALYZED IN AN INTEGRATED APPROACH BY THREE MAIN RESEARCH TASKS TO ADDRESS EACH SCIENTIFIC QUESTION. OVER 2 000 RADAR PROFILES ACQUIRED BY THE MARS ADVANCED RADAR FOR SUBSURFACE AND IONOSPHERE SOUNDING (MARSIS) REVEAL THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE ENTIRE BASAL UNIT  INCLUDING THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE RUP.S AND CAVI UNITS  ALLOWING US TO DETERMINE THEIR SPATIAL EXTENT AND RELATIVE VOLUMES. THIS EXTENSIVE DATA SET IS COMPLEMENTED BY A SHALLOW RADAR (SHARAD) 3D DATA VOLUME  WHICH ENABLES AN EVEN MORE DETAILED RECONSTRUCTION OF THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE TWO UNITS AND THE CONTACT BETWEEN THEM. THANKS TO THE MARSIS SIMULTANEOUS OPERATION ON MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES  WE CAN EMPLOY STATE OF THE ART ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES IN MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT APPROACHES TO DETERMINE THE FRACTION OF WATER ICE AND NATURE OF THE LITHIC FINES CONTAINED WITHIN THE RUP.S UNIT  WHICH ARE STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN. FINALLY  WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RUP.S UNIT ACCUMULATED AS A DOME OF MATERIAL GROWING TOWARDS LOWER LATITUDES AND WAS THEN PROGRESSIVELY ERODED IN THE NORTHWARD DIRECTION BY EXAMINING THE IMPACT CRATER RECORD ON THE ADJACENT PLAINS IN HIGH-RESOLUTION VISIBLE IMAGES. EVEN IN THE CASE OF A NULL RESULT  THIS EXERCISE WILL CONSTRAIN THE ABSOLUTE AGES OF THE RUP.S UNIT MAIN ACCUMULATION AND EROSION EVENTS  THUS PROVIDING INSIGHT TO THE TIMING OF VOLATILE AND LITHIC TRANSPORT ON AT LEAST A REGIONAL SCALE DURING THE LATE HESPERIAN AND EARLY AND MIDDLE AMAZONIAN PERIODS. RELEVANCE: THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE MDAP OBJECTIVE OF ENHANCING THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN FROM MISSIONS TO MARS CONDUCTED BY NASA AND OTHER SPACE AGENCIES.

| UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA | NASA | REFLECTED LIGHT PHASE CURVES -- WHICH MEASURE THE REFLECTIVITY OF A WORLD AS A FUNCTION OF THE STAR-WORLD-OBSERVER (PHASE) ANGLE -- ENCODE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT SCATTERING PROCESSES IN ATMOSPHERES AND FROM SURFACES. FOR EXAMPLE  PHASE CURVES CAN REVEAL ENHANCEMENTS FROM BOTH AEROSOL SCATTERING (DUE TO  E.G.  FORWARD SCATTERING OR RAINBOW FEATURES) AND SPECULAR REFLECTION FROM A LIQUID (E.G.  OCEAN GLINT FOR EARTH). THE NARROW PHASE ANGLE COVERAGE ACCESSIBLE FOR OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM WORLDS HAS LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO USE GROUND-BASED OBSERVING TO CAPTURE PHASE CURVES FOR MOST SOLAR SYSTEM WORLDS WITH THICK ATMOSPHERES. THUS  INTERPLANETARY SPACECRAFT PROVIDE THE BEST PLATFORMS FOR CHARACTERIZING PLANETARY PHASE CURVES. SUCH DATASETS WILL SOON HAVE MUCH-ENHANCED VALUE FOR COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY  AS BOTH THE ROMAN CORONAGRAPH INSTRUMENT (RCI) AND THE HABITABLE WORLDS OBSERVATORY (HWO) WILL BE CAPABLE OF OBSERVING REFLECTED LIGHT PHASE CURVES FOR EXOPLANETS. TO DATE  HOWEVER  PHASE CURVE INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE FOR TWO IMPORTANT SOLAR SYSTEM WORLDS: TITAN AND EARTH. CRITICALLY  PHASE CURVES FROM TITAN WOULD SERVE AS IMPORTANT COMPARISON POINTS FOR MORE HAZE-COVERED  WARM GIANT EXOPLANETS (AS WOULD BE OBSERVED BY ROMAN) AS WELL AS AN EARLY/ARCHEAN EARTH-LIKE PLANET. ALONGSIDE THIS  THE PHASE-DEPENDENT REFLECTIVITY OF EARTH IS A KEY INPUT TO FUTURE DIRECT IMAGING MISSIONS. PHASE CURVE INFORMATION AT HIGH PHASE ANGLES (I.E.  AT CRESCENT PHASES) FOR BOTH TITAN AND EARTH CAN HELP US TO UNDERSTAND HOW SPECULAR REFLECTION FROM OCEANS AND SEAS COULD BE DETECTED IN DISK-INTEGRATED OBSERVATIONS. TO ENABLE BOTH FUTURE EFFORTS IN COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY AS WELL AS STUDIES OF GLINT DETECTABILITY  WE PROPOSE A MUCH-NEEDED ANALYSIS OF EXISTING TITAN AND EARTH OBSERVATIONS. FOR TITAN  CASSINI/VIMS-DERIVED WHOLE-DISK OBSERVATIONS WILL BE REDUCED TO PROVIDE HAZY WORLD PHASE CURVES THAT EXTEND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PHASE-DEPENDENT SCATTERING PROCESSES AT KEY NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTHS AND GEOMETRIES. THESE PHASE CURVES WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO ROMAN AND WOULD ENABLE PREDICTIONS FOR HWO. FOR EARTH  WHOLLY UNANALYZED DATA FROM NASA'S CLEMENTINE AND MESSENGER MISSIONS WILL BE USED TO CREATE FIRST-OF-THEIR-KIND  WAVELENGTH-RESOLVED PHASE CURVES FOR THE PALE BLUE DOT. WE WILL ANALYZE THE TITAN AND EARTH RESULTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND GLINT EFFECTS AND WILL PUBLICLY RELEASE OUR DETAILED PHASE CURVES TO EMPOWER ROMAN AND HWO SCIENCE. OUR EFFORTS TO BETTER ENABLE COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY STUDIES OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES ARE RELEVANT TO EXOPLANET RESEARCH PROGRAM GOALS IN EXOPLANET DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION. GIVEN THAT MODERN SOLAR SYSTEM PLANETARY SCIENCE EMPHASIZES RESOLVED OBSERVATIONS  OUR DISK-INTEGRATED PRODUCTS PRIMARILY ADVANCE EXOPLANET SCIENCE  AS REQUIRED BY THE EXOPLANET RESEARCH PROGRAM CALL. | 3/6/2025 |  | $378.22 |

| THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - LOS ANGELES | NASA | SINCE 1892  WHEN AN AURORA WAS FIRST IMAGED BY MARTIN BRENDEL  A GERMAN PHYSICIST  USEFUL AURORAL IMAGES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED ONLY WHEN THE AURORA IS IN DARKNESS. RAYLEIGH SCATTERING OF SUNLIGHT BY THE TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE DURING DAYTIME PRODUCES BROADBAND EMISSIONS THAT ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BRIGHTER THAN THE INTENSITIES OF UV AND VISIBLE EMISSIONS FROM EVEN THE MOST INTENSE AURORA  THEREBY RENDERING THE AURORAL EMISSIONS UNOBSERVABLE FROM GROUND-BASED CAMERAS. AURORAE UNDER THE SUN (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS SUNLIT AURORA) AT HIGH MAGNETIC LATITUDES ARE OBSERVABLE FROM SPACE USING UV INSTRUMENTS BUT SUFFER FROM POOR SPATIAL RESOLUTION NEAR THE ORBIT APOGEE OR POOR TEMPORAL SAMPLING NEAR THE ORBIT PERIGEE  AS WELL AS FROM THE UV AIRGLOW CONTAMINATION THAT HAS THE SAME WAVELENGTH WITH THE UV AURORA. AS A RESULT  SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT DAYSIDE AND SUNLIT AURORAL DYNAMICS REMAIN UNANSWERED OR ONLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THESE QUESTIONS INCLUDE: 1) HOW DO THE DAYSIDE MAGNETOSPHERE AND IONOSPHERE RESPOND TO INTENSE SOLAR WIND VARIATIONS IN TERMS OF AURORAL FORMS AND THEIR DYNAMICS? 2) WHAT IS THE DAYSIDE AURORAL HEMISPHERICAL ASYMMETRY? 3) ARE AURORAS IN DARKNESS AND UNDER SUNLIGHT DIFFERENT OR SIMILAR IN FORMS AND DYNAMICS? ARE THERE UNIQUE SIGNATURES IN SUNLIT AURORA AND WHAT CAUSES THEM? THESE QUESTIONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE DAYSIDE AURORAL FORMS (DIFFUSE AND DISCRETE MORPHOLOGIES) AND THEIR VARIATIONS ARE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE SOLAR WIND AND EARTH S MAGNETOSPHERE  AND THEREFORE DIRECTLY SUPPORT NASA STRATEGIC SUBGOAL 2.2:  UNDERSTAND THE SUN AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH EARTH AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM.  THE SOLUTION NEEDED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IS THE ABILITY TO IMAGE AURORAL FORMS AND THEIR DYNAMICS IN THE DAYSIDE OR SUNLIT AURORAL IONOSPHERE. TO MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH IN OUR CAPABILITY OF AURORAL IMAGING  THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE OF HOW TO IMAGE SUNLIT AURORAS FROM THE BALLOON PLATFORM USING HIGH-PERFORMANCE NEAR-INFRARED (NIR) CAMERA. WHEN THE AURORAL MEASUREMENTS FROM BALLOONS IN ANTARCTICA ARE CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE GROUND-BASED ASI AND MSP OBSERVATIONS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE  THE PROPOSED THREE SCIENCE QUESTIONS CAN BE EXAMINED AND ANSWERED. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF THIS INVESTIGATION  SIX OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED: 1) DEVELOP A CUSTOMIZED NIR INGAAS CAMERA HEAD; 2) DEVELOP AN ONBOARD DATA PROCESSING UNIT  IBOARD  WHICH USES TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AT JPL ALONG WITH A CUSTOMIZED ALGORITHM TO MAXIMIZE ONBOARD DATA PROCESSING CAPABILITY  SPECIFICALLY FOR BALLOON FLIGHTS; 3) BUILD A CUSTOMIZED LARGE FIELD-OF-VIEW OPTICAL SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES A 40 NM BAND-PASS FILTER CENTERED AT 1109 NM TO ELIMINATE THE OH AIRGLOWS AND SKY BACKGROUND  BUT ALLOW THE N2+ MEINEL (0-0) EMISSIONS; 4) INTEGRATE THE CAMERA SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF~3 KM AT ~1000 KM DISTANCE AT THE BALLOON ALTITUDE AND TEST THE SYSTEM FROM THE GROUND BY IMAGING AURORA DURING TWILIGHT WHEN THE SKY BRIGHTNESS IS ANALOGOUS TO THAT AT 35-40 KM ALTITUDE IN ANTARCTIC SUMMER; 5) TEST THE CAMERA FROM BALLOON FLIGHTS TO PROVE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMAGING SUNLIT AURORA FROM THE BALLOON AND TO FINALIZE THE MOST EFFECTIVE FLIGHT ALTITUDE; 6) OBSERVE AURORA FROM A LONG-DURATION BALLOON FLIGHT IN ANTARCTICA  ANALYZE THE DATA  AND SUMMARIZE THE SCIENCE RESULTS THAT ADDRESS THE THREE SCIENCE QUESTIONS. A PROOF OF THE PROJECT CONCEPT IN 2006 HAS CONFIRMED THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH AND HAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE NEW METHOD IS COST EFFECTIVE COMPARED TO SPACE-BORNE IMAGERS  AND OFFERS CAPABILITIES NOT CURRENTLY OBTAINABLE FROM SPACE AND THE GROUND. THIS WORK IS PROPOSED TO BE CONDUCTED AS FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH. | 3/6/2025 |  | $27,233.11 |
| THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - LOS ANGELES | NASA | CHARACTERIZING THE SINGLE SCATTERING PROPERTIES (SSPS) OF REALISTIC HYDROMETEORS IS IMMEDIATELY AND INCREASINGLY NEEDED FOR A BETTER INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS OF PASSIVE AND ACTIVE MICROWAVE PRECIPITATION OBSERVATIONS. A FAITHFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE EM BEHAVIOR OF PRECIPITATION PARTICLES REQUIRES A NUMERICALLY EFFICIENT MODEL TO RIGOROUSLY CALCULATE THE SCATTERING BY ELECTRICALLY LARGE PARTICLES WITH REALISTIC COMPLEX SHAPES AND DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES  AND THIS OVER A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICLE ORIENTATIONS. THE DISCRETE DIPOLE APPROXIMATION (DDA) IS ONE OF THE MAIN APPROACHES THAT HAS BEEN USED TO THIS END IN THE LAST DECADE  BEING A GEOMETRY-FLEXIBLE AND NUMERICALLY LOW-COST TECHNIQUE FOR COMPUTING SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION OF LIGHT BY PARTICLES OF ARBITRARY GEOMETRY AND INTERNAL DIELECTRIC COMPOSITION. THE DDA IS A POWERFUL TECHNIQUE BASED ON MAPPING THE COMPLEX-SHAPED PARTICLE INTO AN ARRAY OF N DIPOLES THAT TOGETHER REPRODUCE THE SHAPE AND INTERNAL OPTICAL RESPONSE OF THE ORIGINAL PARTICLE. NEVERTHELESS  THE DDA PRESENTS TWO MAJOR LIMITATIONS. FIRST  THE ACCURACY OF THIS APPROXIMATION STRONGLY DEPENDS ON THE PRECISION OF THE PARTICLE DISCRETIZATION  NAMELY THE INTER-DIPOLE DISTANCE D WHICH MUST FULFILL THE VALIDITY CRITERIA  M KD<0.5 WHERE M IS THE COMPLEX REFRACTIVE INDEX AND K IS WAVELENGTH NUMBER. THEN  SINCE THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE DDA (DDSCAT AND ADDA) ARE ITERATIVE-SOLVER BASED  THE CALCULATION OF ORIENTATIONALLY-AVERAGED SSPS REQUIRES REPEATEDLY SOLVING COMPUTATIONALLY DEMANDING LINEAR EQUATIONS FOR EACH PARTICLE ORIENTATION. IN AGGREGATE TERMS  BEING BASED ON ITERATIVE METHODS  THE DDA IS TODAY EXCESSIVELY SLOW FOR LARGE PARTICLE SIZE PARAMETERS (X=KA)  LARGE VALUES OF THE REFRACTIVE INDEX  LARGE NUMBERS OF DIPOLES AND LARGE TARGET ORIENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE  TH CALCULATION OF THE SCATTERING PROPERTIES OF ONE SINGLE MEDIUM SIZE SNOW AGGREGATE (X=24)  COMPOSED OF N = 140 896 DIPOLES  OVER ONLY 2000 TARGET ORIENTATIONS AT F = 200 GHZ REQUIRES ALMOST 1 YEAR OF CPU TIME WITH DDSCAT. TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION  WE HAVE CHOSEN TO APPLY RATHER A DIRECT SOLVER-BASED METHOD  KNOWN AS THE CHARACTERISTIC BASIS FUNCTION METHOD (CBFM). THIS DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION METHOD IS BASED ON THE GENERATION OF A NEW SET OF BASIS FUNCTION ADAPTED TO THE GEOMETRY OF THE SCATTERER  IN ORDER TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NUMERICAL SIZE OF THE INITIAL EM PROBLEM. THIS ENABLES US TO USE A DIRECT SOLVER FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE FINAL COMPRESSED SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS  WHICH IS BETTER ADAPTED THAN AN ITERATIVE SOLVER FOR MULTIPLE RIG HAND SIDES PROBLEMS. NAMELY  THE CBFM WILL ENABLE US TO TRANSFORM THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM OF SIZE 3N 3N TO A COMPRESSED ONE OF SIZE K K  WITH K<<3N  THEN INVERT THE FINAL COMPRESSED MATRIX ONLY ONCE FOR ALL THE NEEDED INCIDENT DIRECTIONS (EQUIVALENT TO TARGET ORIENTATION WITH A FIXED INCIDENT DIRECTION). THUS  THE CBFM-BASED MODEL IS MUCH BETTER ADAPTED FOR THE CALCULATION OF EM SCATTERING BY NUMERICALLY AND ELECTRICALLY LARGER PARTICLES WITH A LARGER NUMBER OF PARTICLE ORIENTATIONS. APPLIED TO NUMERICALLY MEDIUM SNOW PARTICLES  OUR CBFM-BASED MODEL FOR NUMERICALLY EFFICIENT SCATTERING BY COMPLEX-SHAPED PARTICLES (NESCOP) HAS BEEN SHOWN IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH DDSCAT  WHILE PROVIDING A DRAMATIC GAIN IN CPU TIME REDUCING IT FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE SNOW AGGREGATE ABOVE FROM 1 YEAR TO FEW HOURS. THESE PROMISING RESULTS ARE SPURRING US TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND COMPUTATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF NESCOP IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THE PMM COMMUNITY IS FACING TODAY TO CALCULATE THE SSPS OF REALISTIC SOLID AND MIXED-PHASE HYDROMETEORS. IF THIS PROJECT ACHIEVES ITS GOALS  NESCOP WILL ENABLE US  NOT ONLY TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE TIME COST ASSOCIATED TO LARGE COMPLEX-SHAPED HYDROMETEORS WITH LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICLE ORIENTATIONS  BUT MORE  IT WILL ALLOW US TO RUN CALCULATIONS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFORM WITH AVAILABLE DDA IMPLEMENTATIONS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $2,504.30 |

| THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - LOS ANGELES | NASA | THE SCIENTIFIC GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A DYNAMICAL HELIOSPHERIC MODELING FRAMEWORK THAT WILL REPRODUCE THE GLOBAL  LARGE SCALE SOLAR WIND EVOLUTION THROUGH A MORE ACCURATE  LOCAL DESCRIPTION OF KINETIC DYNAMICS IN THE HELIOSPHERE. TO THIS END IT INTEGRATES AND COMBINES EXPERTISE FROM THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL KINETIC PLASMA MODELING  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/MACHINE LEARNING (AI/ML)  AND IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOLAR WIND. THE EVOLUTION OF PARTICLE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS WITH HELIOCENTRIC DISTANCE IS CONTROLLED BOTH BY LARGE SCALE DRIVING AND LOCAL KINETIC EFFECTS  WITH THE LATTER INCLUDING PROCESSES SUCH AS INSTABILITIES  WAVE-PARTICLE INTERACTIONS  MAGNETIC RECONNECTION AND TURBULENCE. SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IN SPACE AND TIME SEPARATE KINETIC SCALES IN THE SOLAR WIND FROM THE SCALES OF THE GLOBAL EVOLUTION FROM THE SUN. FOR THIS REASON  MODELING OF KINETIC PROCESSES HAS CLUSTERED AT THE TWO EXTREMES OF THE SCALE SEPARATION: (1) LARGE SCALE MODELS FOCUS ON LARGE SCALE EVOLUTION OF PARTICLE VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS (VDFS)  AIMING AT REPRODUCING OBSERVATIONS AT 1 AU AND BEYOND  BUT SIGNIFICANTLY APPROXIMATING THE KINETIC SOLAR WIND DYNAMICS THAT DRIVE VDF EVOLUTION (2) FULLY KINETIC (E.G. PARTICLE IN CELL- PIC) MODELS FOCUS ON KINETIC SCALE PROCESSES (MAGNETIC RECONNECTION  TURBULENCE  WAVES AND INSTABILITIES)  ACCURATELY REPRODUCING LOCAL DYNAMICS BUT PREVENTED  FROM THE INESCAPABLE COST OF PIC SIMULATIONS  FROM ADDRESSING THEIR COUPLING WITH LARGER SCALE DYNAMICS. OUR NEW MODELING FRAMEWORK WILL BE BUILT BY HARNESSING THE POWER OF STATE OF THE ART KINETIC SIMULATIONS OF THE SOLAR WIND  LOCAL SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS AT DIFFERENT HELIOCENTRIC DISTANCES AND AI/ML TECHNIQUES. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT  VALIDATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF A GLOBAL SOLAR WIND MODEL THAT GLOBALLY EVOLVES SOLAR WIND MODELS ON THE BASIS OF REALISTICALLY MODELED LOCAL KINETIC PROCESSES.

| THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - LOS ANGELES | NASA | MIDLATITUDE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS SUCH AS COLD AIR OUTBREAKS  HEAT WAVES  FLOODS AND DROUGHTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE CLIMATE-RELATED DAMAGE. IN RECENT DECADES NORTHERN HEMISPHERE MIDLATITUDE CONTINENTS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL UNUSUALLY COLD WINTERS  CONCURRENT WITH RAPID ARCTIC WARMING AND SEA ICE LOSS. THE RAPID TRANSITION FROM PROLONGED DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA IN 2012-2016 TO SEVERE FLOODING IN 2017 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SWITCH FROM ATMOSPHERIC RIDGE TO TROUGH IN THE NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC. SUMMER HEAT WAVES AND RELATED EXTREMES IN RECENT YEARS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH QUASI-RESONANCE AMPLIFICATION OF PLANETARY ROSSBY WAVES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. HOWEVER  IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN MIDLATITUDE CIRCULATION AND EXTREMES WERE CAUSED BY ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE OR INTERNAL VARIABILITY IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR CHANGES IN MIDLATITUDE CIRCULATION AND WEATHER EXTREMES (E.G.  BLOCKING AND ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS) IN A CHANGING CLIMATE  INCLUDING THE INTERNAL ATMOSPHERIC VARIABILITY  THE RESPONSE TO TROPICAL AND ARCTIC FORCINGS  AND THE ROLE OF THE STRATOSPHERE IN THE UNFORCED AND FORCED VARIABILITY.

IN PARTICULAR  WE WILL DEVELOP ROBUST OBSERVATION-BASED MEASURES TO EVALUATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH MIDLATITUDE WEATHER SYSTEMS AND MOISTURE TRANSPORT  AND THEIR IMPACTS ON TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION EXTREMES ARE PROPERLY REPRESENTED IN EARTH SYSTEM MODELS WE STRIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF INTERNAL VARIABILITY  TROPIC-MIDLATITUDE-ARCTIC INTERACTIONS  AND STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE COUPLING IN THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN EXTREME EVENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY WILL HELP IMPROVE THE MODEL REPRESENTATION OF MIDLATITUDE CIRCULATION AND EXTREMES AND THUS PRODUCE MORE CREDIBLE PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. BY COLLABORATING WITH GISS AND JPL SCIENTISTS  THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO NASA S MODELING EFFORTS THROUGH THE USE OF SATELLITE RETRIEVALS OF WATER VAPOR AND PRECIPITATION AS OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS OF MIDLATITUDE CIRCULATION AND MOISTURE TRANSPORT IN CLIMATE MODELS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $16,046.48 |
| THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - LOS ANGELES | NASA | MAGNETIC FLUX ROPES  IN WHICH THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS CONFINED IN A TWISTED BUNDLE OF MAGNETIC FLUX  ARE FOUND IN THE SOLAR WIND BETWEEN THE PLANETS (ALSO KNOWN AS INTERPLANETARY CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS  OR ICMES) AND ALSO IN THE EARTH'S MAGNETOSHEATH (AS MAGNETIC FLUX TRANSFER EVENTS  OR FTES). THE FLUX ROPES AT EARTH PRODUCED BY TIME-VARYING MAGNETIC RECONNECTION AT THE MAGNETOPAUSE MAY BE THE EASIEST TO UNDERSTAND AS THEY ARE UBIQUITOUS AND WE HAVE ABUNDANT DETECTOR COVERAGE. WHEN SUCH FLUX BUNDLES ARE MADE IN TRANSIENT RECONNECTION EVENTS ON AND NEAR THE MAGNETOPAUSE  THEY MAY BECOME TANGLED SO THAT TWO ROPES ARE PULLED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE TWISTED ROPES BECOME RECONNECTED  FORMING TWO NEW ROPES AS THEY DISCONNECT. THIS PROCESS CAN NOW BE SIMULATED AND THIS PROJECT INTENDS TO COMPARE ROPES AT DIFFERENT PHASES OF ENTANGLEMENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF MODELS. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE MAGNETIZED SOLAR WIND LEADS TO ENERGY TRANSFER INTO THE MAGNETOSPHERE DURING FLUX ROPE INTERACTION EVENTS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $11,935.89 |

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THIS PROPOSAL WILL INVESTIGATE THE MISSING SOLAR CYCLE RESPONSE IN MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE  WATER VAPOR AND ICE DURING THE RECENT 15 YEARS. IT HAS LONG BEEN CONSIDERED THAT THE 11-YEAR SOLAR CYCLE WILL IMPACT THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE BY ALTERING PHOTOCHEMISTRY  HEATING  AND THE CIRCULATION. PRIOR TO NASA'S UARS MISSION (1991-2005)  THE PRINCIPAL INDICATION OF SOLAR CYCLE EFFECTS IN THE UPPER MESOSPHERE WAS THE DECADAL OSCILLATION OBSERVED IN POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS (PMC) [DELAND AND THOMAS  2015]. THESE ICE CLOUDS NEAR 83 KM ALTITUDE ARE EXCELLENT MONITORS OF MESOSPHERIC VARIABILITY DUE TO THEIR EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO TEMPERATURE AND WATER VAPOR. PMCS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REDUCED (ENHANCED) DURING SOLAR MAXIMUM (MINIMUM) DUE TO INCREASED (DECREASED) HEATING AND WATER VAPOR PHOTOLYSIS. HOWEVER  FROM ~2000 TO PRESENT  THE SOLAR CYCLE RESPONSE OF THE POLAR UPPER MESOSPHERE APPEARS TO BE MISSING  AS EVIDENT IN MEASUREMENTS OF PMCS [E.G.  FIEDLER ET AL.  2011; SISKIND ET AL.  2013; HERVIG ET AL.  2016]. THE RELATIVELY QUIESCENT MAXIMUM ASSOCIATED WITH CYCLE 24 MAY BE A FACTOR; HOWEVER  THE EXPECTED LARGE SURGE IN PMC OCCURRENCE DURING THE PREVIOUS DEEP SOLAR MINIMUM FROM 2007-2010 WAS NOT EVIDENT. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE OBSERVED DECADAL OSCILLATIONS IN PMCS DURING 1979-2000 WERE AMPLIFIED BY MECHANISMS OTHER THAN SOLAR FORCING. A RECENT INVESTIGATION PROPOSED THAT SOLAR CYCLE EFFECTS DURING THE 1980'S AND 90'S WERE AMPLIFIED BY VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS THAT WERE COINCIDENT WITH SOLAR MAXIMA (EL CHICHON IN 1982 AND PINATUBO IN 1991) [HERVIG ET AL.  2016]  ALTHOUGH THIS ASSERTION REMAINS UNTESTED. ANOTHER STUDY NOTED THE COINCIDENCE OF THE 1990S SOLAR MINIMUM TO LOW TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE STRATOSPHERE AND MESOSPHERE [LUBKEN ET AL.  2009]  AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO A REVERSAL OF COOLING TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH OZONE RECOVERY BEGINNING IN THE MID-1990S. OUR SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RESPONSE OF THE MESOSPHERE TO SOLAR CYCLE VARIABILITY AND THE MENTIONED FORCING MECHANISMS USING AN ARRAY OF OBSERVATIONS FROM NASA SATELLITES AND FOCUSED MODELING EXPERIMENTS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES TWO PRINCIPAL SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS: 1. WHAT IS THE SOLAR CYCLE RESPONSE IN THE POLAR SUMMER MESOSPHERE AND WHY IS IT MISSING DURING THE RECENT 15 YEARS? 2. HAVE FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGING OZONE  VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS  OR INCREASING GREENHOUSE GASES CONTRIBUTED TO OR SUBTRACTED FROM SOLAR CYCLE EFFECTS? OUR SCIENCE OBJECTIVE IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY GOAL TO DETERMINE THE DYNAMICS AND COUPLING OF EARTH'S MAGNETOSPHERE  IONOSPHERE  AND ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL INPUTS  AND TO THE HELIOPHYSICS SUPPORTING RESEARCH (H-SR) GOAL TO ADDRESS SOLAR OUTPUT IONOSPHERE/ATMOSPHERE COUPLING. TO UNTANGLE THIS MYSTERY  WE PROPOSE A COORDINATED EFFORT TO INVESTIGATE SUN-EARTH CONNECTIONS USING AN ARRAY OF SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS AND FOCUSED MODELING STUDIES. THIS PROPOSAL USES PMC OBSERVATIONS AS A MONITOR OF THE UPPER MESOSPHERE  BECAUSE THE CONTINUOUS OBSERVATION RECORD FAR EXCEEDS THAT FOR T AND H2O  AND BECAUSE PMC VARIATIONS ARE A PROVEN SURROGATE FOR MONITORING T AND H2O [HERVIG ET AL.  2015; 2016]. THE SBUV INSTRUMENTS COMPRISE THE LONGEST PMC MEASUREMENT RECORD AVAILABLE (1979 TO PRESENT)  WHICH IS READILY COMPARABLE TO MODELS. IN ADDITION TO SBUV  SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS OF PMC'S FROM HALOE AND AIM WILL BE USED TOGETHER WITH MEASUREMENTS OF MESOSPHERIC T AND H2O FROM HALOE  SABER  MLS  AND AIM TO FORM A BASELINE TIME-SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS THAT WILL BE COMPARED WITH THE PROPOSED MODELING SIMULATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL USE THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE COMMUNITY CLIMATE MODEL WITH PMC MICROPHYSICS (WACCM-PMC) TO RUN A SERIES OF FOCUSED EXPERIMENTS TO QUANTIFY THE INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS FORCING MECHANISMS ON MESOSPHERIC CONDITIONS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $5,612.74 |
| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THE SUN'S MAGNETISM PRESENTS MAJOR CHALLENGES TO UNDERSTAND BOTH HOW THE OBSERVED 11-YEAR CYCLES OF MAGNETIC ACTIVITY ARE ACHIEVED AND WHERE THE STRONG FLUX LOOPS THAT BREAK THROUGH THE SURFACE AS SUNSPOT PAIRS ARE ACTUALLY FORMED. CLEARLY A MAGNETIC DYNAMO IS OPERATING WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION ZONE  YET SORTING OUT HOW THIS ZONE'S INTENSELY TURBULENT FLOWS YIELD ORDERLY MAGNETIC BEHAVIOR REVEALS MANY PUZZLES. THE CLEAREST INDICATORS OF THE SUN'S MAGNETIC CYCLE ARE THE SUNSPOTS WHICH FOLLOW FAIRLY ORDERLY AND SYSTEMATIC EMERGENCE PATTERNS AS THE CYCLES PROCEED. YET THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND DEBATE AS TO WHERE THE TOROIDAL FLUX LOOPS ORIGINATE THAT RISE THROUGH THE SURFACE TO FORM INDIVIDUAL SUNSPOT PAIRS  AND INDEED HOW THEY ARE FORMED IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE ARE NOW IN A POSITION TO ADDRESS THE ORIGINS OF SUNSPOTS  INFORMED BY THREE RECENT ADVANCES IN SOLAR DYNAMO THEORY. FIRSTLY  GLOBAL 3-D MHD SIMULATIONS CARRIED OUT IN FULL SPHERICAL SHELLS  SUCH AS WITH OUR ANELASTIC SPHERICAL HARMONIC (ASH) CODE  ARE SHOWING THAT DYNAMO ACTION CAN BUILD WREATHS OF STRONG TOROIDAL MAGNETIC FIELD IN THE BULK OF THE CONVECTION ZONE. THIS IS CONTRARY TO BELIEFS THAT SUCH ORDERED STRUCTURES COULD NOT SURVIVE IN THE MIDST OF THE INTENSE TURBULENCE THERE. SECONDLY  OUR 3-D GLOBAL SIMULATIONS WITH FULL DYNAMICAL FEEDBACKS ARE ACHIEVING DYNAMO CYCLES WITH REGULAR REVERSALS IN THE LARGE-SCALE MAGNETIC FIELDS INVOLVING WREATHS. SOME EXHIBIT EQUATORWARD PROPAGATION OF TOROIDAL FLUX DURING THE CYCLES  REMINISCENT OF THE SUN. THIRDLY  WE HAVE FOUND THAT LOOPS OF MAGNETIC FIELD CAN SEPARATE SPONTANEOUSLY FROM THE WREATHS THROUGH BUOYANCY INSTABILITY AND RISE TOWARD THE SURFACE  PROVIDING FLUX EMERGENCE FROM SITES THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN ANTICIPATED. WE SHALL COMPARE OUR STATISTICS ON RISING LOOPS WITH SUNSPOT EMERGENCE PROPERTIES OBTAINED FROM RECENT DETAILED STUDIES AVAILABLE OF THE CONTINUOUS MAGNETOGRAM IMAGES FROM 1995 ONWARD BY MDI ON SOHO AND NOW HMI ON SDO.

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF CUBESAT: INNER RADIATION BELT EXPERIMENT (CIRBE) IS TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE FORMATION AND DECAY OF THE INNER BELT (L<2) ELECTRONS (100S OF KEV TO MULTIPLE MEV)  AND TO DETERMINE THE INTENSITY AND DYNAMIC VARIATIONS OF THESE ELECTRONS WITH A STATE-OF-ART INSTRUMENT FITTED INTO A CUBESAT IN A HIGHLY INCLINED LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO). METHODOLOGY. CIRBE IS IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR TO OUR PREVIOUS VERY SUCCESSFUL CUBESAT (CSSWE) BUT DIFFERS IN THAT IT WILL HAVE EXTREME FINE ENERGY RESOLUTION (100S OF ENERGY CHANNELS INSTEAD OF 3). WE PROPOSE TO ADVANCE THE EXISTING REPTILE DESIGN BY INCORPORATING FULL PULSE HEIGHT ANALYSIS (PHA)  WHICH HAS BEEN ROUTINELY PERFORMED ON REPT  AND ADDITIONAL ANTI-COINCIDENCE TECHNIQUE  WHICH HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE FRONT DETECTOR OF REPT  SUCH THAT IT WILL HAVE THE FINE ENERGY RESOLUTION PLUS MUCH CLEANER MEASUREMENTS  BUT STILL FIT IN A 3U CUBESAT.

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | SUMMARY. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO ANALYZE ICESAT-2 ICE SURFACE DATA FOR GLACIOLOGICAL REGIONS THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF DIFFERENT SURFACE TYPES AND OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GLACIAL ACCELERATION AND MELT PROCESSES  AND THUS TO EVALUATE AND DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITY OF ICESAT-2 TO PROVIDE OBSERVATIONS THAT AID IN SOLVING URGENT RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO DYNAMIC AND CLIMATIC CHANGES IN THE CRYOSPHERE.AS IS WELL-KNOWN  A MULTI-BEAM MICRO-PULSE PHOTON-COUNTING LASER ALTIMETER WAS SELECTED AS THE INSTRUMENT FOR THE ICESAT-2 MISSION  BECAUSE THE RESULTANT DATA CAN BE EXPECTED TO CAPTURE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN ICE-SURFACE HEIGHT THAT IS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THOSE PROCESSES THAT DRIVE RAPID CHANGES IN THE CRYOSPHERE (ABDALATI ET AL.  2010; MARKUS ET AL.  2017)  FOREMOST MELT EVENTS AND GLACIAL ACCELERATION. GLACIAL ACCELERATION IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN ASSESSMENT OF SEA-LEVEL RISE (SLR) IN THE CURRENT REALM OF CLIMATIC WARMING  ACCORDING TO THE FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT (AR 5) OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) (STOCKER ET AL.  2013). IN 2012  UNPRECEDENTED LARGE MELT EVENTS THAT AFFECTED MUCH OF THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET DROVE HOME THE NOTION THAT THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET HAS ALREADY ENTERED A DIFFERENT REALM REGARDING SURFACE MASS BALANCE (SMB) (NGHIEM ET AL.  2012; HALL ET AL.  2013; TEDESCO ET AL.  2013). AS A MEANS TO FULLY USE THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES OF THE MICRO-PULSE PHOTON-COUNTING TECHNOLOGY  THE PI HAS DEVELOPED A DENSITY-DIMENSION ALGORITHM FOR ICE-SURFACE ANALYSIS (THE DDA-ICE) WHICH ALLOWS TO ACCURATELY RETRIEVE ICESAT-2 SURFACE HEIGHTS EVEN IN REGIONS OF HEAVY CREVASSING OR FIRN COVER AND UNDER INTERMITTENT CLOUDS (HERZFELD ET AL.  2017). SURFACE HEIGHTS RESULTANT FROM THE DD A-ICE WILL HAVE THE RESOLUTION OF THE GEOLOCATED PHOTON-DATA (EXPECTED AS 0.7 M ALONG-TRACK POSTINGS UNDER CLEAR ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS). OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED WORK ARE TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF ICESAT-2 MEASUREMENTS WHEN ANALYZED WITH THE DDA-ICE (W.R.T. SPATIAL VARIABILITY  ACCURACY  PRECISION AND UNCERTAINTY) USING AIRBORNE DATA OF KEY GLACIER REGIONS  IMPLEMENT THE APPROACH AS AN OPERATIONAL ALGORITHM ON THE NASA CLOUD  INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF PERFORMING REPEAT PROCESSING OF ALL ATL03 DATA OVER THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET  AND ANALYZE FIRST ATLAS DATA RIGHT AFTER LAUNCH (AS SOON AS ATL03 DATA BECOME AVAILABLE) AIMED AT DERIVING FIRST ICESAT-2 RESULTS ON MELT AND ACCELERATION PROCESSES. THE IDEA IS TO SHOW WHAT TYPES OF RESULTS CAN BE GAINED FROM THE HIGH-RESOLUTION ATLAS DATA. PROTOTYPE ICESAT-2 ATLAS RESEARCH DATA PRODUCTS WILL BE DEVELOPED WITH APPLICATIONS IN MIND. THE EVALUATION OF SURFACE-HEIGHT DETERMINATION WILL INCLUDE COLLECTION OF AIRBORNE LASER ALTIMETER DATA  TIME-LAPS IMAGERY AND REAL-TIME KINEMATIC (RTK) GPS DATA OF THE ICE SURFACE OF AN ARCTIC GLACIER DURING SURGE (NEGRIBREEN  SVALBARD)  AUGMENTING AN EXISTING PROJECT OF THE PI  ALONG ICESAT-2 GROUND TRAC | 3/6/2025 |  | $2,061.94 |
| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | BACKGROUND: SULFATE MINERALS OF THE ALUNITE-JAROSITE GROUP HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AT NUMEROUS LOCATIONS ACROSS MARS  INCLUDING TWO OF THE ROVER LANDING SITES. BECAUSE JAROSITE ONLY PRECIPITATES UNDER ACIDIC AND OXIDIZING CONDITIONS  IT IS USEFUL INDICATOR OF CONDITIONS IN AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS ON EARLY MARS. JAROSITE IS ALSO THOUGHT TO DECOMPOSE RELATIVELY RAPIDLY WHEN EXPOSED TO CIRCUMNEUTRAL FLUIDS  LEADING TO INFERENCES THAT SITES WHERE THIS MINERAL OCCURS ON MARS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO FLUIDS FOR ONLY VERY LIMITED AMOUNTS OF TIME FOLLOWING PRECIPITATION. MANY OCCURRENCES OF JAROSITE AND ALUNITE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ON MARS ARE FOUND IN LAYERED DEPOSITS SUGGESTIVE OF SEDIMENTARY ACCUMULATION  BUT THE ORIGIN OF JAROSITE AND ALUNITE IN THESE SETTINGS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT THESE MINERALS ARE DIAGENETIC PRODUCTS FORMED AFTER THE SEDIMENTS WERE EMPLACED  BUT THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW TERRESTRIAL ANALOG STUDIES OF DIAGENETIC PRECIPITATION OF JAROSITE AND ALUNITE IN SEDIMENTARY SETTINGS TO SERVE AS A POINT OF COMPARISON. THE PRESENCE OF JAROSITE- AND ALUNITEBEARING CEMENTS IN JURASSIC SEDIMENTARY ROCKS OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY DIAGENETIC PRECIPITATION OF THESE MINERALS IN A SETTING THAT MAY BE ANALOGOUS TO LAYERED DEPOSITS ON MARS. ACCORDINGLY  WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE JAROSITE- AND ALUNITE-BEARING CEMENTS IN THESE ROCKS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES UNDER WHICH THEY PRECIPITATED  AND TO USE THIS INFORMATION TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO POSSIBLE PATHWAYS FOR THE PRECIPITATION OF ALUNITE-JAROSITE GROUP MINERALS IN MARTIAN LAYERED DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION  SINCE THE JAROSITE AND ALUNITE IN THE JURASSIC SANDSTONES/SILTSTONES HAVE PERSISTED FOR FAR LONGER THAN THE INFERRED LIFETIME OF JAROSITE IN AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS ON MARS  THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE POTENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM PRESERVATION OF THESE MINERALS IN MARTIAN DEPOSITS. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT ARE TO: (A) DETERMINE THE ORIGIN OF THE JAROSITE- AND ALUNITE-BEARING CEMENTS THAT OCCUR IN JURASSIC SANDSTONES AT MOLLIES NIPPLE  UTAH (MN) AND OTHER SIMILAR DEPOSITS ON THE COLORADO PLATEAU  AND (B) TO COMPARE THE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND INFERRED PROCESS FOR PRECIPITATION OF THE CEMENTS WITH LOCATIONS WHERE JAROSITE AND ALUNITE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN LAYERED DEPOSITS ON MARS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THOSE MINERALS COULD HAVE A SIMILAR ORIGIN. METHODS: THE MINERALOGY  CHEMISTRY  AND DEPOSITIONAL SETTING OF THE JAROSITE- AND ALUNITE-BEARING SANDSTONES WILL BE THOROUGHLY CHARACTERIZED USING A VARIETY OF APPROACHES  INCLUDING FIELD STUDY OF SEDIMENTOLOGICAL STRUCTURES AND ANALYSIS OF ROCKS BY OPTICAL AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY  X-RAY DIFFRACTION  ELECTRON MICROPROBE ANALYSIS  AND VISIBLE/NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL SCENARIOS FOR PRECIPITATION OF THE JAROSITE/ALUNITE CEMENTS  WHICH WILL BE FURTHER TESTED WITH QUANTITATIVE GEOCHEMICAL MODELS. RELEVANCE TO NASA: THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE SOLAR SYSTEM WORKINGS OBJECTIVE OF UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION AND MODIFICATION OF PLANETARY SURFACES. IN PARTICULAR  THE PROJECT WOULD PROMOTE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE AQUEOUS PROCESSES AND GEOCHEMICAL CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO THE WIDESPREAD OCCURRENCE OF SULFATE DEPOSITS ON THE SURFACE OF MARS | 3/6/2025 |  | $804.53 |
| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | CONDUCT A CONCEPT STUDY OF THE INITIALLY PROPOSED INVESTIGATION AND PROVIDE A REPORT ON THIS STUDY BY JUNE 3  2019. PRECIPITATION INTO THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF LOSS FROM THE RADIATION BELTS. NUMEROUS SPACECRAFT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MEASURE THIS ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION (EEP) FROM LOW-EARTH ORBIT (LEO); HOWEVER  CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION IS NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE THE LOSS CONE ANGLE NOR MEASURE THE PITCH ANGLE DISTRIBUTION  AND THUS THE ENERGY DEPOSITION IN THE ATMOSPHERE HAS A LARGE UNCERTAINTY. FURTHERMORE  PARTICLE DETECTORS ON SPACECRAFT PROVIDE IN-SITU DETECTION ONLY  AND SINGLE-SPACECRAFT MISSIONS CANNOT PROVIDE INSTANTANEOUS SPATIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRECIPITATION PATCHES. | 3/6/2025 |  | $42,409.33 |
| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | WE PROPOSE TO APPROACH THIS GOAL THROUGH THE FOLLOWING PROCESS. WE WILL USE TWO ADVANCED CORONAL MHD MODELS  THE RADIATIVE MHD CODE (RADMHD  ABBETT W.P. 2007  APJ 665  1469) AND THE MAGNETIC FLUX ERUPTION CODE (MFE  FAN 2012  APJ  758  60)  AND TOOLS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE CORONAL GLOBAL EVOLUTIONARY MODEL FRAMEWORK (CGEM  NASA LWS STRATEGIC CAPABILITY PROJECT  FISHER ET AL. 2015  SPW  13  369) TO PERFORM DATA-DRIVEN SIMULATIONS OF TWO FLARING ACTIVE REGIONS. THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS APPROACH IS APPLICATION OF A WELL-TESTED PDFI INVERSION TECHNIQUE TO INFER THE ELECTRIC FIELDS FROM SEQUENCES OF SDO VECTOR MAGNETOGRAMS (KAZACHENKO ET AL. 2014  APJ  795  17) THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DRIVE THE MODELS' PHOTOSPHERIC LAYERS IN A MANNER THAT IS PHYSICALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE OBSERVED EVOLUTION. WE WILL EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT TEMPORAL COMBINATIONS OF CGEM AND MHD RUNS AND WILL ANALYZE HOW DIFFERENTLY SPECIFIED INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AFFECT THE SIMULATIONS' OUTCOME. | 3/6/2025 |  | $6,733.79 |

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THE UNIVERSE IS ACCELERATING TODAY  WHEN DARK ENERGY IS THE DOMINANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE COSMIC ENERGY BUDGET  AND IT DECELERATED AT EARLIER TIMES WHEN MATTER WAS THE DOMINANT FLUID. THE ACCELERATION ITSELF IS INFERRED FROM OBSERVATIONS OF "STANDARD RULERS" AND "STANDARD CANDLES" THAT RELY ON CAREFUL CALIBRATION  MODELS  AND THE COSMIC DISTANCE LADDER. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN RECENT TENSION IN THE VALUE OF THE HUBBLE CONSTANT BETWEEN LOCAL OBSERVATIONS AND THOSE THAT RELY ON THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND  WHICH SUGGESTS EITHER UNDERESTIMATION OF SYSTEMATIC ERRORS OR NEW PHYSICS THAT ALTER THE ACCELERATION HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE. THIS PROPOSAL SUGGESTS A THIRD WAY TO APPROACH COSMOLOGY: TO MEASURE THE UNIVERSE'S DYNAMIC NATURE IN REAL TIME. IN THIS CASE  WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE THE VIABILITY OF DIRECTLY MEASURING THE COSMIC ACCELERATION BY PRECISELY MONITORING REDSHIFTS OVER TIME. IN A DYNAMIC UNIVERSE  REDSHIFTS WILL EXHIBIT A SECULAR DRIFT THAT MAY BE POSITIVE (ACCELERATION) OR NEGATIVE (DECELERATION). OBJECTS AT REDSHIFTS AROUND Z  1 SHOULD SHOW MAXIMUM ACCELERATION  AND OBJECTS AT Z &GT; 2.5 SHOULD SHOW DECELERATION. THIS TECHNIQUE SIDESTEPS THE COSMIC DISTANCE LADDER AND DOES NOT RELY ON STANDARD RULERS OR CANDLES. | 3/6/2025 |  | $5,673.79 |
| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THE SOUTH POLAR LAYERED DEPOSITS (SPLD) OF MARS ARE COMPOSED OF PERENNIAL WATER ICE AND DUST THAT SURROUND THE CO2-DOMINATED RESIDUAL ICE CAP (SRIC). THE SPLD  MUCH LIKE THE NORTH POLAR LAYERED DEPOSITS (NPLD)  ARE THOUGHT TO CONTAIN AN OBLIQUITY-DRIVEN CLIMATE SIGNAL. HOWEVER  UNLIKE THE NPLD  THE SPLD SURFACE AGE FROM NUMEROUS PREVIOUS CRATER COUNTING STUDIES PLACES THE DEPOSIT AT LEAST ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE OLDER THAN THE NPLD SURFACE  AND PERHAPS 10S OF MYRS OLD (FAR EXCEEDING THE MODELED ~5 MYR TOTAL LIFETIME OF THE NPLD). LOW RADAR REFLECTIVITY ZONES (LRZS) UNDER THE SRIC ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE CO2 ICE DEPOSITED IN PREVIOUS ~100 KYR CLIMATE VARIATIONS  WHILE THE COMPOSITIONS AND DEPOSITIONAL HISTORY OF LRZS UNDERLYING THE SPLD ARE STILL NOT WELL CONSTRAINED. THE COMPOSITION AND TIMING OF THESE DEPOSITS ARE KEY FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW THE SPLD ACCUMULATED. ADDITIONALLY  THE SPLD S POTENTIALLY COMPLEX EROSIONAL HISTORY  INDICATED BY ITS HIGH BULK DUST CONTENT COMPARED TO THE NPLD  COMPLICATES UNRAVELING WHAT CLIMATE RECORD COULD BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE DEPOSIT. THESE FEATURES MAKE THE SPLD ENIGMATIC BUT CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE AMAZONIAN WATER ICE MASS BALANCE OF MARS  AND BY EXTENSION MARTIAN CLIMATE HISTORY. A GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE SOUTH POLAR REGION OF MARS WOULD PROVIDE NECESSARY CONTEXT TO SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR THESE INTERPRETATIONS HOWEVER  A HIGH-RESOLUTION/LOW-MAP-SCALE GEOLOGIC MAP IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL PRODUCE A UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (USGS) SCIENCE INVESTIGATION MAP OF THE SOUTH POLAR REGION OF MARS (70  S TO 90  S) AT A FINAL MAP SCALE OF 1:2 000 000. WE WILL USE THE THEMIS DAYTIME IR MOSAIC (100 M/PIXEL) AS OUR PRIMARY BASEMAP  WITH MARS CONTEXT CAMERA (CTX) AND MARS ORBITER LASTER ALTIMETER (MOLA) AS SUPPLEMENTAL DATASETS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $21,525.07 |
| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THE VOYAGER SPACECRAFT ENCOUNTERED ALL OF THE GIANT PLANETS: VOYAGERS 1 & 2 BOTH FLEW PAST JUPITER IN MARCH AND JULY 1979  AND ENCOUNTERED SATURN IN NOVEMBER 1980 AND AUGUST 1981  WITH VOYAGER 2 MOVING ON TO URANUS IN JANUARY 1986 AND ENDING WITH NEPTUNE IN SEPTEMBER 1989. THE VOYAGER PLASMA SCIENCE (PLS) INSTRUMENT COMPRISED FOUR FARADAY CUPS ON EACH SPACECRAFT WHICH MEASURED IONS AND ELECTRONS WITH ENERGY-PER-CHARGE BETWEEN 10 AND 5950 VOLTS. PI FRAN BAGENAL (CU) WAS SUPPORTED BY A JDAP GRANT TO RE-ANALYZE THE VOYAGER PLS DATA AT JUPITER WHICH RESULTED IN 3 PUBLICATIONS AND ARCHIVING OF THE DATA AND ANALYSIS ROUTINES. THE PLAN IS TO ARCHIVE THE COMPLETE MAGNETOSPHERIC DATA SETS FROM SATURN  URANUS AND NEPTUNE INCLUDING THE MEASURED CURRENTS IN ALL MODES OF OPERATION OF THE INSTRUMENT  AND POINTING INFORMATION. WE ALSO PROPOSE TO PROVIDE A GENERAL MAGNETOSPHERIC ANALYSIS CODE AND WILL ARCHIVE A VERSION OF THE MOST GENERAL ANALYSIS CODE  ALONG WITH THE DATA AND POINTING INFORMATION.

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THE PROPOSED WORK ENSURES THE CONTINUITY OF THREE LONG-TERM  HIGH-QUALITY WATER VAPOR MEASUREMENT RECORDS IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE AND LOWER STRATOSPHERE (UTLS). THE IN SITU SOUNDINGS ARE PERFORMED AT LEAST MONTHLY BY BALLOON-BORNE NOAA FROST POINT HYGROMETERS (FPHS) AT BOULDER  COLORADO (40 N)  HILO  HAWAII (20 N) AND LAUDER  NEW ZEALAND (45 S). WITH A LENGTH NOW EXCEEDING 40 YEARS  THE NOAA FPH DATA SET OVER BOULDER  COLORADO  IS THE LONGEST OBSERVATIONAL RECORD FOR UTLS WATER VAPOR IN EXISTENCE. THE FPH DATA RECORDS AT LAUDER (~16 YRS) AND HILO (~10 YRS) ARE SOMEWHAT SHORTER IN LENGTH BUT ARE PROVIDING PERTINENT INFORMATION ABOUT UTLS WATER VAPOR IN THE SOUTHERN MIDDLE LATITUDES AND NORTHERN SUBTROPICS  RESPECTIVELY. SUPPORTING FUNDS WILL HELP TO MOVE FORWARD THE EXISTING FPH SOUNDING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE PROVEN BENEFICIAL TO NASA S SPACE-BORNE UTLS WATER VAPOR MEASUREMENTS IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST  THE BALLOON-BORNE MEASUREMENTS HAVE PROVIDED A STABLE AND CONSISTENT FOUNDATION FOR THE DETECTION (AND POTENTIAL CORRECTION) OF BIASES AND/OR DRIFTS IN SATELLITE INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE AURA MICROWAVE LIMB SOUNDER (MLS) AND THE STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL AND GAS EXPERIMENT (SAGE-III) CURRENTLY DEPLOYED ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). SINCE TRENDS IN UPPER ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR ARE TYPICALLY SMALL RELATIVE TO SEASONAL AND INTER-ANNUAL VARIABILITY  TREND DETECTION REQUIRES ACCURATE AND STABLE MEASUREMENT RECORDS LIKE THOSE COMPILED FROM FPH SOUNDINGS. SECOND  THE INEVITABLE DEMISE OF MLS WILL LIKELY REDUCE  BY &GT;95%  THE CURRENT SPATIOTEMPORAL DENSITY OF UTLS WATER VAPOR MEASUREMENTS FROM SPACE. THE FPH SOUNDINGS PROPOSED HERE WOULD HELP TO FILL ANY TEMPORAL GAP THAT ARISES. THIRD  THE FPH SOUNDINGS AT ALL THREE SITES ARE NOW VITAL TO TWO INTERNATIONAL MEASUREMENT NETWORKS THAT FOCUS ON DETECTING TRENDS IN ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND ESSENTIAL CLIMATE VARIABLES: THE NETWORK FOR THE DETECTION OF ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION CHANGE (NDACC) AND THE GLOBAL CLIMATE OBSERVING SYSTEM (GCOS) REFERENCE UPPER AIR NETWORK (GRUAN). BOTH OF THESE NETWORKS DEPEND ON A STABLE CORE OF SELF-FUNDED SITES WITH SUSTAINABLE MONITORING PROGRAMS  HENCE THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL NEED TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF THE FPH MEASUREMENT RECORDS AT BOULDER  HILO AND LAUDER. | 3/6/2025 |  | $26,233.26 |

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | MARS THERMOSPHERE EXTENDS FROM 90 KM TO THE EXOBASE (CA. 200 KM). THERMOSPHERE VARIABILITY AT MARS IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FORCING FROM ITS LOWER ATMOSPHERE  AND BY THE ABSORPTION OF VARIABLE SOLAR EUV RADIATION. MODELING AND SCATTERED OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT MARS THERMOSPHERE IS FURTHERMORE DISTINGUISHED BY ITS LONGITUDINAL VARIABILITY  WHICH VARIES WITH LATITUDE  SEASON (LS)  AND HEIGHT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SINCE TRAVELING PLANETARY WAVES (PW) DO NOT EXTEND APPRECIABLY ABOVE 100 KM  THAT MOST LONGITUDINAL VARIABILITY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SPECTRUM OF SOLAR TIDES PROPAGATING UP FROM BELOW  WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM STATIONARY PW (SPW) EXCITED IN-SITU BY TIDE-TIDE NONLINEAR INTERACTIONS. IN A 2020 PAPER BY THE PI  IT IS SHOWN THAT THE MARS CLIMATE DATA BASE (MCD)  WHICH IS BASED ON A FIRST PRINCIPLES MODEL EXTENDING FROM MARS SURFACE TO THE EXOSPHERE  APPROXIMATES WELL THE TIDAL SPECTRUM AT 75 KM ALTITUDE MEASURED BY MRO/MCS  AND PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ORIGINS OF LONGITUDINAL DENSITY STRUCTURES AT AEROBRAKING ALTITUDES (100-120 KM). THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICAL COUPLING BETWEEN THE LOWER/MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS AS EMBODIED IN 75-KM ALTITUDE MCS MEASUREMENTS  AND THE THERMOSPHERE UP TO THE EXOSPHERE (CA. 90-200 KM) AND INCLUDING THE AEROBRAKING REGION (100-120 KM). NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ORIGINS AND POTENTIAL PREDICTABILITY OF AEROBRAKING-REGION DENSITIES IS EXPECTED TO EMERGE. SINCE TIDAL DISSIPATION IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE ZONAL-MEAN CIRCULATION AND SPECIFICALLY THE HADLEY-TYPE CELL THAT EXTENDS INTO THE THERMOSPHERE  NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE LMD GCM S CAPABILITY TO MODEL TRANSPORT OF H2O AND H2 INTO THE THERMOSPHERE AND EXOSPHERE ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO EMERGE. | 3/6/2025 |  | $4,622.46 |
| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OF MARS  INCLUDING THE UPPER MESOSPHERE AND THERMOSPHERE  PROVIDE THE MAIN RESERVOIR FOR ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE. GIVEN ITS DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SOLAR EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET (UV) RADIATION AND ITS STRONG COUPLING WITH THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE  THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE IS SUBJECT TO STRONG VARIABILITY DRIVEN BOTH FROM ABOVE (SOLAR FORCING) AND FROM BELOW (VIA WAVES AND TIDES). THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNDERSTAND AND CHARACTERIZE THE MIDDLE AND UPPER ATMOSPHERE DYNAMICS USING THE UV AIRGLOW MEASUREMENTS FROM MARS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY ANALYZING TWO LARGE UV DAYGLOW DATASETS FOR MARS AND INTERPRET THE RESULTS USING MARS GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCM). WE WILL USE 10 YEARS OF DAYGLOW DATA OBSERVED BY SPICAM (SPECTROSCOPY FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ATMOSPHERE OF MARS) ONBOARD MARS EXPRESS AND COMPREHENSIVE DAYGLOW DATA FROM IUVS (IMAGING ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROGRAPH) ONBOARD MAVEN MISSION. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT COMPLETE DATASETS FROM THE TWO MOST POWERFUL UV INSTRUMENTS WILL BE INTERPRETED USING TWO OF THE MOST COMPLETE GCMS.

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | RAPID SUB-SECOND RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION  TERMED MICROBURSTS  HAS LONG BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH WHISTLER MODE CHORUS WAVE ACTIVITY. THE SIMILAR DISTRIBUTIONS IN LOCAL TIME AND L SHELL BETWEEN THE WAVES AND PRECIPITATION FEATURES SUGGEST THAT THE TWO PHENOMENA ARE LIKELY RELATED  AND THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT CHORUS WAVES CAN RAPIDLY SCATTER ENERGETIC ELECTRONS THROUGH NONLINEAR INTERACTIONS. WHILE THE OCCURRENCE RATES AND MAGNITUDES OF RELATIVISTIC MICROBURSTS HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY PREVIOUS AUTHORS  THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE MORE DETAILED PROPERTIES OF THESE PHENOMENA  WHICH CAN GIVE FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THEIR GENERATION. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DATA ANALYSIS  RAY TRACING  AND TEST PARTICLE SIMULATIONS  WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE WHAT KEY CHORUS WAVE PROPERTIES (E.G. FREQUENCY EXTENT  SWEEP RATE  WAVE AMPLITUDE  LATITUDE OF INTERACTION) CONTROL MICROBURST CHARACTERISTICS (E.G. BURST DURATION  PITCH ANGLE ANISOTROPY  ENERGY DEPENDENCE) AND HOW ARE THESE ARE MEDIATED BY WAVE-PARTICLE INTERACTION PHYSICS. SPECIFICALLY  WE AIM TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS: 1. WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON MICROBURSTS? 2. HOW ARE RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON MICROBURSTS PRODUCED? 3. WHAT WAVE AND PLASMA CHARACTERISTICS DICTATE THE PRECIPITATION PROPERTIES? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS  WE WILL UTILIZE A COMBINATION OF DATA ANALYSIS  INCLUDING MICROBURST MEASUREMENTS BY SATELLITES IN LOW- EARTH ORBIT (LEO) AND CHORUS WAVE MEASUREMENTS NEAR THE EQUATORIAL PLANE  AS WELL AS TEST PARTICLE SIMULATIONS TO STUDY CHORUS WAVE ELECTRON INTERACTIONS. WE PROPOSE TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1. ANALYZE MICROBURST PROPERTIES IN THE SAMPEX AND FIREBIRD II DATASETS  INCLUDING BURST DURATION  ENERGY DEPENDENCE  AND PITCH ANGLE ANISOTROPY 2. ANALYZE CHORUS WAVE PROPERTIES IN VAN ALLEN PROBE DATA  INCLUDING FREQUENCY EXTENT  SWEEP RATE  AND WAVE AMPLITUDE 3. PERFORM TEST PARTICLE SIMULATIONS TO MODEL CHORUS WAVE-ELECTRON INTERACTIONS AND EXAMINE KEY MAGNETOSPHERIC PARAMETERS THAT CONTROL MICROBURST PRECIPITATION PROPERTIES THROUGH DATA-MODEL COMPARISONS  WE WILL EXPLORE THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MEASURED AND SIMULATED MICROBURST PROPERTIES  RELATING BOTH INDIVIDUAL BURST CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS THEIR GLOBAL DEPENDENCIES TO CHORUS WAVE PARAMETERS. RELEVANCE TO NASA: THE PROPOSED WORK IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF NASA S HELIOPHYSICS DIVISION AND ADDRESSES TWO OF THE FOUR HELIOPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY GOALS   DETERMINING THE DYNAMICS AND COUPLING OF EARTH S MAGNETOSPHERE  IONOSPHERE  AND ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR RESPONSE TO SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL INPUTS  AND  DISCOVERING AND CHARACTERIZING FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BOTH WITHIN THE HELIOSPHERE AND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.  WAVE-PARTICLE INTERACTIONS ARE UBIQUITOUS THROUGHOUT THE HELIOSPHERE AND HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR PARTICLE ENERGIZATION AS WELL AS SCATTERING. AS ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION IS A CRITICAL PROCESS BOTH FOR RADIATION BELT DYNAMICS IN EARTH S MAGNETOSPHERE AS WELL AS FOR ENERGY INPUT TO EARTH S ATMOSPHERE  THE RESULTS OF THIS EFFORT WILL HAVE IMPORTANT CROSS-DISCIPLINARY IMPLICATIONS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $13,834.15 |

OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT PLASMA GENERATED FROM INTENSE DUST IMPACTS IN THE PLUME CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO DATA COLLECTED BY CAPS AND LP. SINCE THE AMOUNT OF DUST IMPACT PLASMA IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO DUST MASS DENSITY  CHARACTERIZATION OF THE IMPACT PLASMA DETECTED WITHIN THE PLUME ALLOWS US TO DERIVE PLUME DUST MASS DENSITY PROFILES INDEPENDENT OF THE DUST SIZE DISTRIBUTION. OUR FIRST PROPOSED TASKS ARE TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT PLASMA PROCESS CAUSED BY PLUME ICE GRAINS USING MULTIPLE IN SITU DATASET. APPLYING CHARACTERIZED IMPACT PLASMA PARAMETERS TO ANALYZE IN SITU DATASET FROM VARIOUS PLUME CROSSING FLYBYS  WE WILL EVALUATE THE PLUME DUST VARIATION OVER ENCELADUS ORBIT AND ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SCIENCE QUESTIONS: (1) DOES THE BRIGHTENING OF ENCELADUS PLUME NEAR ITS ORBITAL APOCENTRE CAUSE BY INCREASING DUST PRODUCTION AND/OR CHANGING DUST SIZE DISTRIBUTION? (2) WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF PLUME ICY GRAINS REGARDING PLUME-MAGNETOSPHERE INTERACTIONS? WE ALSO PLAN TO DEVELOP AN AD-HOC PLUME DUST MODEL. | 3/6/2025 |  | $11,376.56 |

| UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO | NASA | OBJECTIVES. THE MINIATURE X-RAY SOLAR SPECTROMETER (MINXSS) PROGRAM IS A SUCCESSFUL SCIENCE CUBESAT MISSION FOR THE H-TIDES LCAS PROGRAM  AND WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE MINXSS STUDIES WITH A SECOND LAUNCH IN DECEMBER 2016 WITH IMPROVED INSTRUMENTATION FOR A NEW 4-YEAR MISSION. THE ORIGINAL MINXSS-1 MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF SOLAR FLARE SOFT X-RAY (SXR) EMISSIONS AND ITS IMPACT ON EARTH S IONOSPHERE  THERMOSPHERE  AND MESOSPHERE (ITM). THESE STUDIES  CURRENTLY FUNDED THROUGH 2016  FOCUS ON THE SOLAR SXR VARIABILITY OF ACTIVE REGION EVOLUTION AND FLARES DURING THE MINXSS-1 SIX-MONTH MISSION  MODELING OF THE SOLAR SXR VARIABILITY  AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THE SOLAR SXR ENERGIZES EARTH S IONOSPHERIC E-REGION (80-150 KM). THE MINXSS-2 MISSION WITH ITS LONGER 4-YEAR LIFE WILL EXTEND THESE STUDIES DURING THE DECLINING PHASE OF SOLAR CYCLE 24  CYCLE MINIMUM  AND THE RISING PHASE OF SOLAR CYCLE 25. MINXSS WILL ENHANCE THESE ORIGINAL STUDIES DURING THESE DIFFERENT SOLAR CYCLE PHASES BY CHARACTERIZING THE DIFFERENCES IN (1) THE ACTIVE REGION HEATING / ABUNDANCE  (2) FLARE ENERGETICS  AND (3) SOLAR FORCING IN EARTH S UPPER ATMOSPHERE. METHODOLOGY. MINXSS IS A SOLAR-ORIENTED  3-AXIS-CONTROLLED  3-UNIT CUBESAT TO OBSERVE THE SOLAR SXR SPECTRUM BETWEEN 0.6 AND 30 KEV (0.04 AND 2 NM). THE X-RAY SPECTROMETER ON MINXSS HAS A NOMINAL SPECTRAL RESOLUTION OF 0.15 KEV FULL WIDTH HALF MAXIMUM (FWHM). THE CAPABILITIES OF THIS X-RAY SPECTROMETER HAVE BEEN FLIGHT-PROVEN ON MINXSS-1 AND ALSO PREVIOUSLY ON SOUNDING ROCKET FLIGHTS IN 2012 AND 2013. AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THIS X-RAY SPECTROMETER IS ON MINXSS-2. THE OTHER MAJOR TECHNOLOGY ON MINXSS IS THE ATTITUDE DETERMINATION AND CONTROL SYSTEM (ADCS) FROM BLUE CANYON TECHNOLOGIES (BCT); THE BCT 0.5-UNIT ADCS HAS BEEN FLIGHT PROVEN ON MINXSS-1 WITH PRECISION SOLAR POINTING TO ~10 ARC-SECONDS. THE MINXSS-1 WAS LAUNCHED IN DECEMBER 2015 TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) AND DEPLOYED FROM THE ISS ON MAY 16  2016. STARTING FROM THE ISS ALTITUDE OF ~400 KM  THE MINXSS-1 MISSION LIFE IS ONLY ABOUT 6 MONTHS. THE MINXSS-2 SPACECRAFT WAS BUILT IN PARALLEL WITH MINXSS-1 AND IS BEING DELIVERED TO SPACEFLIGHT INDUSTRIES IN FALL 2016 FOR ITS LAUNCH INTO A 500-KM SUN-SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT (SSO). THIS FREE RIDE-OF-OPPORTUNITY FOR MINXSS-2 FROM GOOGLE TERRA BELLA (FORMERLY SKYBOX IMAGING) WAS NOT PLANNED IN THE ORIGINAL MINXSS PROGRAM THAT ONLY PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINXSS SPACECRAFT AND THE MINXSS-1 MISSION THROUGH 2016. THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTS THE NEW MINXSS-2 MISSION FOR TWO YEARS (2017-2018) AND AN EXTENDED MISSION FOR TWO MORE YEARS (OR OPPORTUNITY TO BE EXTENDED IN THE NEXT SENIOR REVIEW IN 2017). AS WITH MINXSS-1  CLOSURE ON THE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES INVOLVES COMPARISONS WITH SDO AND RHESSI MEASUREMENTS  ITM MODELING USING THE NCAR THERMOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE-MESOSPHERE-ELECTRODYNAMICS GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL (TIME-GCM)  AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE EMPIRICAL FLARE IRRADIANCE SPECTRAL MODEL (FISM) THAT IS USED FOR A VARIETY OF SPACE WEATHER RESEARCH APPLICATIONS. NEW FOR MINXSS-2 IS THE ADDITION OF COMPARATIVE STUDIES WITH HINODE AND NUSTAR SOLAR MEASUREMENTS  STUDIES CORRELATING THE MEASURED PHOTOSPHERIC MAGNETIC FIELD FLUX TO SOFT X-RAY SPECTRA  AND PHYSICS-BASED MODELING OF THE SXR SPECTRA. WE HAVE ADDED TWO MORE CO-IS FOR SUPPORTING THE EXTRA RESEARCH  AND WE ARE ALSO ADDING A SECOND GROUND STATION AT GEOPHYSICAL INSTITUTE (GI) IN ALASKA FOR INCREASING THE DAILY DATA DOWNLINK BY A FACTOR OF SIX OVER MINXSS-1. WE ARE WILLING TO SHARE LASP AND GI GROUND STATIONS WITH ANOTHER NASA CUBESAT. | 3/6/2025 |  | $15,463.78 |
| UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON - SEATTLE | NASA | SNOWSTORMS CAUSE MAJOR SOCIETAL IMPACTS  SUCH AS PUBLIC SAFETY  TRANSPORTATION  AND COMMERCE  ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHLY POPULATED EAST COAST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES (US). MULTISCALE SNOW BANDS WITHIN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF WINTER STORMS ARE THE PRIMARY FOCAL POINTS FOR THE MOST INTENSE SNOWFALL  BUT ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. THE INVESTIGATION OF MICROPHYSICS AND PRECIPITATION FOR ATLANTIC COAST-THREATENING SNOWSTORMS (IMPACTS) COMPRISES A SET OF AIRCRAFT AND PAYLOADS IDEALLY-SUITED TO THE STUDY OF EASTERN US SNOWSTORMS. USING DATA FROM A "SATELLITE-SIMULATING" ER-2 AIRCRAFT AND IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS FROM A CLOUDPENETRATING P-3 AIRCRAFT  IMPACTS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF SNOW BAND FORMATION AND EVOLUTION WITHIN WINTER STORMS  WILL PROVIDE OBSERVATIONS THAT WILL ENABLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MEASUREMENT OF SNOWFALL FROM SPACE  AND WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT DATA FOR THE VALIDATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF NUMERICAL MODELS. THE IMPACTS SCIENCE OBJECTIVES ARE TO: (1) CHARACTERIZE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES AND STRUCTURES OF SNOWBANDS IN NORTHEAST US WINTER STORMS; (2) UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICAL  THERMODYNAMICAL  AND MICROPHYSICAL PROCESSES THAT PRODUCE THE OBSERVED STRUCTURES; (3) APPLY THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURES AND UNDERLYING PROCESSES TO IMPROVE REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING OF SNOWFALL. IMPACTS INSTRUMENT SUITE INCLUDES MULTIPLE FREQUENCY RADAR (W  KA  KU AND X BANDS)  PASSIVE MICROWAVE (10-183 GHZ)  AND LIDAR ON THE ER-2  AND IN-SITU CLOUD MICROPHYSICS  ATMOSPHERIC STATE PARAMETERS  AND DROPSONDE ON THE P-3. AIRCRAFT DATA WILL BE COMBINED WITH GROUND-BASED RAWINSONDES AND OPERATIONAL RADARS  RESEARCH RADARS  SATELLITE DATA  AND MODEL-DERIVED ANALYSES AND SIMULATIONS TO ACHIEVE THE MISSION SCIENCE OBJECTIVES. IMPACTS ADDRESSES THE NASA EARTH SCIENCE ENTERPRISE SCIENCE GOAL TO STUDY EARTH TO ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING AND MEET SOCIETAL NEEDS  AND THE NASA WEATHER FOCUS AREA'S RESEARCH OBJECTIVE TO "ENABLE IMPROVED PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR WEATHER AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS." IMPACTS IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES RECOMMENDATION FOR A DESIGNATED PROGRAM FOCUSED ON CLOUDS  CONVECTION  AND PRECIPITATION. PROJECT START IS JANUARY 1  2019  WITH A DURATION OF FIVE YEARS. THE REGION OF FOCUS IS THE US NORTHEAST  INCLUDING THE IMMEDIATE OFFSHORE AREA  AND A SECONDARY REGION IN THE MIDWEST DEPENDING ON WHERE SNOWSTORMS ARE OCCURRING. MEASUREMENTS WILL BE COLLECTED DURING THREE 6-WEEKS DEPLOYMENTS  EACH FROM MID-JANUARY THROUGH FEBRUARY  2020-2022 IN ORDER TO BEST MATCH THE CLIMATOLOGY OF SNOWSTORMS IN THE US NORTHEAST AND MIDWEST. | 3/6/2025 |  | $9,808.88 |

| MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY | NASA | THE INSTITUTE FOR ULTRA-STRONG COMPOSITES BY COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN (US-COMP) WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE MODELING-DRIVEN DESIGN OF A NEW CLASS OF ULTRA-HIGH-STRENGTH-LIGHTWEIGHT (UHSL) MATERIALS FOR FUTURE MANNED MARS MISSIONS. THESE MATERIALS WILL MEET THE REQUIRED MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE GOALS SET FORTH BY NASA AND EXCEED THOSE EXHIBITED BY CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART CARBON-FIBER COMPOSITES. US-COMP S VISION IS TO SERVE AS A FOCAL POINT FOR PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN NASA  OTHER AGENCIES  INDUSTRY  AND ACADEMIA TO: (1) ENABLE COMPUTATIONALLY-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT OF CARBON NANOTUBE (CNT)-BASED UHSL STRUCTURAL MATERIALS AND (2) EXPAND THE RESOURCE OF HIGHLY SKILLED ENGINEERS  SCIENTISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS IN THIS EMERGING FIELD TO ENHANCE THE U.S. LEADERSHIP IN CRITICAL LIGHTWEIGHT STRUCTURAL MATERIALS. THIS VISION WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE FOUR PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVES:   ESTABLISH A NEW COMPUTATIONALLY-DRIVEN MATERIAL DESIGN PARADIGM FOR RAPID MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT   DEVELOP A NOVEL UHSL STRUCTURAL MATERIAL FOR USE IN DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION. THE PANEL-LEVEL TESTS AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE NOVEL MATERIALS WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO MOVE THE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY TO A TECHNICAL READINESS LEVEL (TRL) OF 4.   DEVELOP NOVEL MODELING  PROCESSING  AND TESTING TOOLS AND METHODS FOR CNT-BASED COMPOSITE MATERIALS   ESTABLISH A POOL OF HIGHLY SKILLED ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY AND DIVERSE TEAM OF RESEARCHERS FROM ACADEMIA  INDUSTRY  AND NATIONAL LABS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT. THE COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN OF THE MATERIAL WILL BE DRIVEN BY A MODELING EFFORT TO INTEGRATE TOPOLOGICAL OPTIMIZATION  ATOMISTIC MODELING  MOLECULAR MODELING  MESOSCALE MODELING  AND CONTINUUM-BASED COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS. INNOVATIONS IN MATERIALS SYNTHESIS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES WILL ENSURE THE PERFORMANCE AND SCALE-UP FABRICATION OF AEROSPACE-QUALITY TEST SAMPLES AND PANELS. MULTISCALE TESTING AND CHARACTERIZATION CAPABILITIES WILL BE ESTABLISHED AND INTEGRATED TO VALIDATE THE MODELING AND MANUFACTURING EFFORTS AND TO COMPLETE THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT CYCLE. PARTICIPATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS WILL PROVIDE AND ENSURE THE SCALABILITY AND AEROSPACE-GRADE QUALITY OF THE DEVELOPED COMPOSITE MATERIAL. THE DEVELOPED MATERIALS AND MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT METHODS WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE AEROSPACE COMMUNITY. FIRST  UHSL MATERIALS WILL BE DEVELOPED WITH THE RIGOROUS STRENGTH  MODULUS  AND FRACTURE TOUGHNESS PROPERTIES NECESSARY FOR MANNED MARS MISSIONS. SECOND  A NEW COMPUTATIONALLY-DRIVEN MATERIALS DESIGN PARADIGM WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO DEVELOP THE UHSL MATERIAL OF INTEREST AND FOR FUTURE RAPID MATERIALS DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. THIRD  A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF LOAD TRANSFER AND MULTISCALE FAILURE MECHANISMS OF CNT-BASED COMPOSITE MATERIALS WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO ACHIEVE THEIR THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE. FOURTH  A REPRODUCIBLE ENGINEERING PERFORMANCE DATA FROM AEROSPACE-QUALITY AND SCALE-UP PANEL TEST RESULTS BUILDING UPON AEROSPACE-GRADE RESIN SYSTEMS AND HIGH-QUALITY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CNT MATERIALS TO ENSURE SCALABILITY TO CONDUCT ASTM STANDARD TESTS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT EMPHASIS OF THE INSTITUTE WILL BE IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. STUDENTS WILL BE TRAINED FOR DEVELOPING AND UTILIZING ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES FOR LIGHTWEIGHT MATERIALS. FUNDS WILL BE RESERVED FOR THE STUDENTS TO HAVE EXTENDED VISITS TO NASA FACILITIES DURING SUMMER MONTHS FOR DIRECT MENTORSHIP BY NASA RESEARCHERS. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL STRENGTHEN THE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE INSTITUTE MEMBERS AND NASA. WITH THE HELP OF THE HBCU PARTICIPANT (FLORIDA A&M UNIVERSITY)  THE INSTITUTE WILL ESTABLISH A DIVERSE GROUP OF BOTH RESEARCHERS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $6,160.68 |

| UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS | NASA | OBJECTIVES: THE MARTIAN POLAR CAPS REPRESENT SOME OF THE MOST DYNAMIC OBJECTS ON PRESENT DAY MARS. THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS AT THE SEASONAL TIMESCALE AND RECORD THE EVOLUTION OF THE MARTIAN CLIMATE AT LONGER TIMESCALES. THEREFORE  DETERMINING THE EVOLUTION OF THE POLAR CAPS OVER TIME IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE FOR CLIMATE MODELING AND UNDERSTANDING RELATED PROCESSES SUCH AS THE TOTAL PRESSURE CYCLE  WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY POLAR CAP SUBLIMATION. THE SOUTH POLAR RESIDUAL CAP (SPRC) INCLUDES SUBLIMATION PITS  THE SO-CALLED SWISS CHEESE TERRAINS. SPRC PITS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO GROW WITH TIME AND REPRESENT ONE STAGE OF THE MARTIAN CO2 CYCLE IN WHICH CO2 ICE MASS IS RETURNED TO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH SEASONAL SUBLIMATION DURING THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUMMER. HOWEVER  THIS GROWTH HAS NOT BEEN FULLY CHARACTERIZED WITH RESPECT TO TIME  GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND RELATED PARAMETERS. OUR GOAL IS TO DETERMINE THE TIME EVOLUTION OF SOUTH POLE RESIDUAL CAP (SPRC) PITS AND THE VOLUME OF CO2 ICE LOST BY SUBLIMATION IN THE MARTIAN SOUTH POLE. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOW: 1 - DETERMINE THE SIZE EVOLUTION OF THE PITS OVER TIME AND AS A FUNCTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION ON THE POLAR CAP 2 - DETERMINE THE CORRESPONDING VOLUMES OF CO2 SUBLIMATED FROM THE SURFACE 3 - EXTRAPOLATE THE PREVIOUS RESULTS TO THE WHOLE SOUTHERN POLAR CAP AND ESTIMATE THE RESULTING INFLUENCE ON THE MARTIAN CLIMATE CYCLE. SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT: THE PROPOSED WORK WOULD BE CARRIED OUT OVER THE SPAN OF 3 YEARS AND INVOLVES THREE PRIMARY TASKS: IN TASK 1  WE WILL SURVEY THE SPRC FOR SUBLIMATION PIT LOCATIONS WITH RECURRING  FREQUENT IMAGES ACQUIRED BY HIRISE. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE SUBLIMATION PITS OF INTEREST USING OBJECT-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS (OBIA) TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE PIT AREAS WHILE SYSTEMATICALLY CALCULATING GROWTH RATES IN TERMS OF AREA CHANGE. THE OBIA APPROACH WILL INCLUDE CREATING TRIMBLE ECOGNITION RULESETS  ALLOWING THE PIT SHAPES TO BE EFFICIENTLY EXTRACTED FROM THE HIRISE IMAGES. THE RESULTS OF THE OBIA WILL BE COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS MANUALLY CALCULATED PIT MEASUREMENTS. THE CONCLUSION OF THIS STEP WILL BE TO DETERMINE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PIT SURFACE AREA AS A FUNCTION OF TIME AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION ON THE SOUTH POLAR CAP. IN TASK 2  WE WILL DETERMINE THE VOLUME OF CO2 ICE LOST THROUGH LOCAL SUBLIMATION BY CREATING DIGITAL TERRAIN MODELS (DTMS) OF LOCATIONS ACROSS THE SPRC FOR WHICH HIRISE STEREO-PAIR IMAGES ARE AVAILABLE. DTMS WILL ALSO BE CREATED USING CONTEXT CAMERA (CTX) IMAGES TO ASSESS VOLUME LOSS THROUGH TIME AT A COARSER RESOLUTION OVER LARGER AREAS TO GAIN FULL SPRC COVERAGE. DTMS WILL BE CREATED USING ESTABLISHED WORKFLOWS WITHIN THE NASA AMES STEREO PIPELINE PAIRED WITH THE USGS INTEGRATED SOFTWARE FOR IMAGERS AND SPECTROMETERS (ISIS 3) . FINALLY  IN TASK 3  WE WILL QUANTIFY THE CO2 ICE LOST THROUGH SUBLIMATION ON THE CAP BY EXTRAPOLATING AND VALIDATING DATA COLLECTED IN TASKS 2 AND 3 TO LOCATIONS THAT LACK RECURRING HIRISE IMAGE COVERAGE TO CREATE A MAP OF ESTIMATED CO2 ICE LOSS THROUGH TIME FOR THE ENTIRE SPRC. WE WILL THEN COMPARE THE RESULTING ESTIMATES TO VARIATIONS IN OTHER DATASETS  AND PARTICULARLY THE SEASONAL PRESSURE CHANGES. RELEVANCE: THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO NASA S MARS DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM BECAUSE IT UTILIZES IMAGERY ACQUIRED BY THE HIRISE AND CTX CAMERAS ON THE MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER TO INVESTIGATE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT SUBLIMATION PITS ON THE SPRC ON MARS. STUDYING HOW THESE CO2 ICE PITS HAVE FORMED AND EVOLVED THROUGH TIME WILL ALSO LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF THE SPRC AND THE CO2 ICE CYCLE ON MARS. | 3/6/2025 |  | $1,428.98 |

| UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA | NASA | MOTIVATION: THE LATEST IPCC REPORT AND RECENT DECADAL SURVEY STATE THAT THE LARGEST UNCERTAINTY IN ESTIMATING GLOBAL ANTHROPOGENIC RADIATIVE FORCING IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERACTIONS OF AEROSOL PARTICLES WITH CLOUDS. THIS LARGE UNCERTAINTY STEMS FROM THE VARIABILITY OF CLOUD SYSTEMS AND THE MULTIPLE FEEDBACKS THAT AFFECT AND HAMPER SCIENTISTS  EFFORTS TO ASCRIBE CHANGES IN CLOUD PROPERTIES TO AEROSOL PERTURBATIONS. WHILE PAST CAMPAIGNS MADE DISCOVERIES THAT RAISED NEW QUESTIONS  OUR PROPOSED AEROSOL CLOUD METEOROLOGY INTERACTIONS OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC EXPERIMENT (ACTIVATE) PROJECT AIMS TO COLLECT SUFFICIENT STATISTICS TO PROVIDE THE ANSWERS.OBJECTIVES: BECAUSE MARINE BOUNDARY LAYER CLOUDS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE PLANET S ENERGY BALANCE  ACTIVATE FOCUSES ON THESE CLOUDS THAT SPAN THE CONTINUUM FROM STRATIFORM TO CUMULUS. OUR FIVE-YEAR PROJECT (1/2019-12/2023) WILL ADDRESS THREE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES (AND BASELINE AND THRESHOLD SCIENCE OBJECTIVES ARE IDENTICAL): A) QUANTIFY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN AEROSOL NUMBER CONCENTRATION (NA)  CLOUD CONDENSATION NUCLEI (CCN) CONCENTRATION  AND CLOUD DROP NUMBER CONCENTRATION (ND)  AND REDUCE UNCERTAINTY IN MODEL PARAMETERIZATIONS OF CLOUD DROPLET ACTIVATION B) IMPROVE PROCESS-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING AND MODEL REPRESENTATION OF FACTORS THAT GOVERN CLOUD MICRO/MACRO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND HOW THEY COUPLE WITH CLOUD EFFECTS ON AEROSOL AND C) ASSESS ADVANCED REMOTE SENSING CAPABILITIES FOR RETRIEVING AEROSOL AND CLOUD PROPERTIES RELATED TO AEROSOL-CLOUD INTERACTIONS. DELIVERABLES: 1) IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING AND MODEL REPRESENTATIONS OF NA-CCN-ND RELATIONSHIPS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MICRO/ MACRO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES 2) A UNIQUE DATASET FOR INTERNATIONAL MODEL INTERCOMPARISON AND PROCESS-BASED STUDIES 3) AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT REMOTE SENSING RETRIEVALS AND PROTOTYPES FOR FUTURE SATELLITE MISSIONS AND 4) THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED SATELLITE-BASED ND RETRIEVALS AND CCN PROXIES. NASA RELEVANCE: ACTIVATE ADDRESSES FOUR NASA EARTH SCIENCE FOCUS AREAS:  ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION    WATER&ENERGY CYCLE    CLIMATE VARIABILITY&CHANGE   AND  WEATHER . OUR MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENT  AUGMENT  AND VALIDATE AEROSOL AND CLOUD RETRIEVALS FROM EXISTING AND PLANNED SATELLITE MISSIONS. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS EXISTING AND DEMONSTRATE NEW LIDAR AND POLARIMETER REMOTE SENSING RETRIEVALS OF AEROSOLS AND CLOUDS  WHICH ARE DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE DECADAL SURVEY RECOMMENDATION FOR A DESIGNATED MISSION TO STUDY AEROSOLS AND CLOUDS. MISSION OVERVIEW AND PLATFORMS: ACTIVATE TARGETS THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN WITH A BROAD RANGE OF AEROSOL AND METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE READILY SAMPLED BY THE TWO COMPLEMENTARY AIRCRAFT BASED AT THE NEARBY NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER: THE NASA HU-25 FALCON AND B-200 KING AIR. THE HU-25 ACQUIRES IN SITU MEASUREMENTS BELOW  IN  AND ABOVE CLOUDS. THE B-200 FLIES ABOVE CLOUDS TO REMOTELY MEASURE AEROSOLS AND CLOUDS AND TO DEPLOY DROPSONDES TO MEASURE THE ATMOSPHERIC STATE. INSTRUMENTS AND MODELS: ALL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED FOR ACTIVATE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES ARE MATURE (TRL 9) THESE ADVANCED  ACTIVE AND PASSIVE REMOTE SENSING AND IN SITU INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE A LOW-RISK  HIGH-IMPACT APPROACH FOR BOTH OBTAINING CRITICAL ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS TO RELATE AEROSOLS  CLOUDS  AND METEOROLOGY  AND IMPROVING MODELS.

| COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY | NASA | THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE STUDIES PROPOSED HERE IS TO ESTABLISH TEMPORAL PROFILES OF HUMAN TELOMERE LENGTH DYNAMICS AND DNA DAMAGE RESPONSES OF IMPORTANCE FOR MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE DURING LONG-DURATION DEEP SPACE MISSIONS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT TELOMERE LENGTH DYNAMICS (CHANGES OVER TIME) REPRESENT A PARTICULARLY RELEVANT AND INFORMATIVE BIOMARKER OF HEALTH FOR THE ASTRONAUTS  AS IT REFLECTS THE COMBINED EXPERIENCES AND EXPOSURES ENCOUNTERED DURING SPACEFLIGHT. THAT IS  AN ASTRONAUT'S INDIVIDUAL GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES  UNIQUE LIFESTYLE STRESSES ENCOUNTERED (E.G.  NUTRITIONAL  PSYCHOLOGICAL  PHYSICAL)  AND PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES (E.G.  MICROGRAVITY  GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS)  ARE ALL INTEGRATED AND CAPTURED AS CHANGES IN TELOMERE LENGTH. THUS  THE RATE AT WHICH TELOMERES SHORTEN PROVIDES A GENERAL MEASURE OF HEALTH THAT CAN BE LINKED TO AGING  AS WELL AS TO RISK OF DEVELOPING DEGENERATIVE AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGIES  RANGING FROM REDUCED IMMUNE FUNCTION AND DEMENTIA  TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND CANCER. IMPORTANTLY  FUNCTIONAL TELOMERES ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING GENOMIC INTEGRITY AND STABILITY  AS THEY PROTECT CHROMOSOMAL TERMINI FROM INAPPROPRIATE DEGRADATION  AND PREVENT THESE NATURAL DNA ENDS FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AS BROKEN DNA AND TRIGGERING INAPPROPRIATE DNA DAMAGE RESPONSES (DDRS). TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN ADAPTATIONS TO HUMAN HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE DURING LONG-DURATION LOW-EARTH ORBIT  WE PROPOSE TELOMERE LENGTH AND DDR/CYTOGENETIC MEASURES PIONEERED AND VALIDATED IN THE NASA TWINS STUDY/FIRST ONE YEAR MISSION  ACROSS THE INTEGRATED ONE- YEAR MISSION PROJECT ONBOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND THE CONCURRENT GROUND ANALOG (PROLONGED ISOLATION) COMPONENT. | 3/6/2025 |  | $7,369.77 |

| BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIV OF WI SYSTEM (THE) | NASA | ANALYSIS OF THE PLANT BIOLOGY TRANSCRIPTOMICS AND PROTEOMICS DATA IN THE GENELAB DATA SYSTEM REVEALS THAT A COMMON FEATURE OF SPACEFLIGHT IS ALTERATION IN PLANT DEFENSE-RELATED TRANSCRIPTS AND PROTEINS IN SPACE. ANECDOTALLY  PLANTS HAVE ALSO BEEN SEEN TO SUFFER FROM PATHOGEN ATTACK DURING SPACEFLIGHT MISSIONS. TAKEN TOGETHER  THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST A HYPOTHESIS THAT PLANT DEFENSE RESPONSES MAY BE COMPROMISED BY SPACEFLIGHT. SUCH A DISRUPTION OF DEFENSE WOULD HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PLANTS GROWN AS PART OF AN ASTRONAUT LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM. THIS IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT GIVEN THE LARGE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY ON BOARD THE ISS AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SPACEFLIGHT TRIGGERS ENHANCED MICROBIAL PATHOGENICITY. HOWEVER  THE CRITICAL UNANSWERED QUESTION IS WHETHER THE ALTERED DEFENSE GENE EXPRESSION SEEN IN SPACEFLIGHT TRULY PLAYS OUT AS ALTERED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PATHOGENS. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO USE THE BRIC-LED HARDWARE GROWING ARABIDOPSIS SEEDLINGS TO DIRECTLY TEST THIS IDEA. SPECIFICALLY  WE PROPOSE TO: (1) CAPITALIZE ON THE UNIQUE CAPABILITIES OF THE BRID-LED HARDWARE TO ANALYZE THE TRANSCRIPTOME AND CELL WALL STRUCTURE RESPONSES OF ARABIDOPSIS SEEDLINGS GROWN IN SPACEFLIGHT. WE PROPOSE TO GROW THESE PLANTS AND THEN CHALLENGE THEM WITH THE BACTERIAL ELICITOR PEPTIDE FLG22. WE WILL COMPARE THESE RESPONSES IN WILD-TYPE AND MUTANTS IN THE DEFENSE REGULATORS ATRBOHD AND CML24. (2) USE COMPARISONS TO GROUND-BASED CONTROL EXPERIMENTS AND CLINOSTAT AND HYPOXIA TREATMENT TO ASK WHETHER SUCH CHANGES ARE LIKELY LINKED TO THE MICROGRAVITY OR HYPOXIC ELEMENTS OF SPACEFLIGHT AND WHETHER THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE PLANT TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST PATHOGEN CHALLENGE. THE BRIC-LED/PDFU HARDWARE IS WELL-SUITED TO THIS EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH. THUS  THE TWO-STAGE PDFU HARDWARE WILL ALLOW BOTH STIMULATION (INJECTION OF FLG22 ELICITOR ONTO THE SEEDLINGS) AND SUBSEQUENT FIXATION OF SAMPLES (WITH RNALATER). AS THE EXPERIMENT WOULD USE FLG22 PEPTIDE TO ELICIT DEFENSE RESPONSE  POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH FLYING LIVE PATHOGEN WILL BE CIRCUMVENTED. THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WILL CAPITALIZE ON THE MINIMAL CREW TIME NEEDED FOR A BRIC-BASED EXPERIMENT AND THE UNIQUE CAPABILITIES OF THE BRIC HARDWARE TO TREAT PLANTS IN SITU ON ORBIT. THE RESULTS FROM THIS EXPERIMENT WILL ALLOW US TO DIRECTLY ASK THE CRITICAL QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ABILITY OF PLANTS TO MOUNT A DEFENSE RESPONSE IS COMPROMISED DURING SPACEFLIGHT. | 3/6/2025 |  | $9,695.64 |

| WOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTION | NASA | A MAJOR DIFFICULTY IN SIMULATING EARTH S CLIMATE SYSTEM IS THAT THERE ARE INTERACTIONS ACROSS SCALES  SO THAT THE LARGE TIME AND SPACE SCALES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO PROCESSES ON SMALL SCALES. AS THE COMPUTATIONAL RESOLUTION OF GLOBAL OCEAN MODELS HAS IMPROVED  SCIENTISTS HAVE BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT KILOMETER-SCALE EDDIES AND FRONTS  CALLED  SUBMESOSCALE  VARIABILITY  HAVE A NET EFFECT ON OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE HEAT EXCHANGE THAT IS LARGER THAN THE HEATING FROM THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT (SU ET AL. 2018). STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTER MODELS AGREE IN PREDICTING THAT THESE EDDIES HAVE IMPORTANT LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON THE UPPER-OCEAN  BUT THEIR PREDICTIONS ARE SENSITIVE TO RELATIVELY SMALL DETAILS IN MODEL PHYSICS AND IMPLEMENTATION. THE RESOLUTION AND DETAIL OF THESE SIMULATIONS HAS SURPASSED OUR ABILITY TO  GROUND TRUTH  THEM WITH SPACEBORNE OR IN SITU SENSORS. THERE IS THUS A PRESSING NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARK DATA SET ON THESE SUBMESOSCALE MOTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN SIMULATING THE GLOBAL OCEAN. THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SUBMESOSCALE OCEAN DYNAMICS MAKE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO VERTICAL EXCHANGE OF CLIMATE AND BIOLOGICAL VARIABLES IN THE UPPER OCEAN. THIS WILL REQUIRE COORDINATED APPLICATION OF NEWLY-DEVELOPED IN SITU AND REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES  AND IT WILL PROVIDE AN UNPRECEDENTED VIEW OF THE PHYSICS OF SUBMESOSCALE EDDIES AND FRONTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON VERTICAL TRANSPORT IN THE UPPER OCEAN.
